        PREFACE 
This work is a labor of love. When I was a little boy, my parents and elder sisters taught me a 
great deal of Greek, Roman, and English history, but America did not come into it. At 
Stonyhurst, my school, I was given a magnificent grounding in English constitutional history, but 
again the name of America scarcely intruded. At Oxford, in the late 1940s, the School of Modern 
History was at the height of its glory, dominated by such paladins as A. J. P. Taylor and Hugh 
Trevor—Roper, Sir Maurice Powicke, K. B. McFarlane, and Sir Richard Southern, two of whom 
I was fortunate to have as tutors and all of whose lectures I attended. But nothing was said of 
America, except in so far as it lay at the margin of English history. I do not recall any course of 
lectures on American history as such. A. J. P. Taylor, at the conclusion of a tutorial, in which the 
name of America had cropped up, said grimly: `You can study American history when you have 
graduated, if you can bear it.’ His only other observation on the subject was: `One of the 
penalties of being President of the United States is that you must subsist for four years without 
drinking anything except Californian wine.’ American history was nothing but a black hole in 
the Oxford curriculum. Of course things have now changed completely, but I am talking of the 
Oxford academic world of half a century ago. Oxford was not alone in treating American history 
as a non—subject. Reading the memoirs of that outstanding American journalist Stewart Alsop, I 
was intrigued to discover that, when he was a boy at Groton in the 1930s, he was taught only 
Greek, Roman, and English history. <br><br>
As a result of this lacuna in my education, I eventually came to American history completely 
fresh, with no schoolboy or student prejudices or antipathies. Indeed my first contacts with 
American history were entirely non—academic: I discussed it with officers of the US Sixth Fleet 
when I was an officer in the Garrison at Gibraltar, during my military service, and later in the 
1950s when I was working as a journalist in Paris and had the chance to meet such formidable 
figures as John Foster Dulles, then Secretary of State, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and his 
successor at SHAPE Headquarters, General Matthew Ridgeway. From the late 1950s I began 
visiting the United States regularly, three or four times a year, traveling all over the country and 
meeting men and women who were shaping its continuing history. Over forty years I have grown 
to know and admire the United States and its people, making innumerable friends and 
acquaintances, reading its splendid literature, visiting many of its universities to give lectures and 
participate in debates, and attending scores of conferences held by American businesses and 
other institutions. <br><br>
In short, I entered the study of American history through the back door. But I also got to know 
about it directly during the research for a number of books I wrote in these years: A History of 
Christianity, A History o f the Jews, Modern Times: the World from the Twenties to the Nineties, 
and The Birth o f the Modern: World Society, 1815—1830. Some of the material acquired in 
preparing these books I have used in the present one, but updated, revised, corrected, expanded, 
and refined. As I worked on the study of the past, and learned about the present by traveling all 
over the world—but especially in the United States—my desire to discover more about that 
extraordinary country, its origins and its evolution, grew and grew, so that I determined in the 
end to write a history of it, knowing from experience that to produce a book is the only way to 
study a subject systematically, purposefully, and retentively. My editor in New York, Cass 
10<br><br>
Canfield Jr of HarperCollins, encouraged me warmly. So this project was born, out of 
enthusiasm and excitement, and now, after many years, it is complete. <br><br>
Writing a history of the American people, covering over 400 years, from the late 16th century 
to the end of the 20th, and dealing with the physical background and development of an immense 
tract of diverse territory, is a herculean task. It can be accomplished only by the ruthless selection 
and rejection of material, and made readable only by moving in close to certain aspects, and 
dealing with them in fascinating detail, at the price of merely summarizing others. That has been 
my method, as in earlier books covering immense subjects, though my aim nonetheless has been 
to produce a comprehensive account, full of facts and dates and figures, which can be used with 
confidence by students who wish to acquire a general grasp of American history. The book has 
new and often trenchant things to say about every aspect and period of America’s past, and I do 
not seek, as some historians do, to conceal my opinions. They are there for all to see, and take 
account of or discount. But I have endeavored, at all stages, to present the facts fully, squarely, 
honestly, and objectively, and to select the material as untendentiously as I know how. Such a 
fact—filled and lengthy volume as this is bound to contain errors. If readers spot any, I would be 
grateful if they would write to me at my private address: 29 Newton Road, London W25JR; so 
that they may be corrected; and if they find any expressions of mine or opinions insupportable, 
they are welcome to give me their comments so that I may weigh them. <br><br>
The notes at the end of the book serve a variety of purposes: to give the sources of facts, 
figures, quotations, and assertions; to acknowledge my indebtedness to other scholars; to serve as 
a guide to further reading; and to indicate where scholarly opinion differs, directing the reader to 
works which challenge the views I have formed. I have not bowed to current academic nostrums 
about nomenclature or accepted the flyblown philacteries of Political Correctness. So I do not 
acknowledge the existence of hyphenated Americans, or Native Americans or any other qualified 
kind. They are all Americans to me: black, white, red, brown, yellow, thrown together by fate in 
that swirling maelstrom of history which has produced the most remarkable people the world has 
ever seen. I love them and salute them, and this is their story. <br><br><br>

PART ONE <br>
‘A City on a Hill’ <br>
Colonial America, 1580 —1750 <br>
12<br><br>
The creation of the United States of America is the greatest of all human adventures. No other 
national story holds such tremendous lessons, for the American people themselves and for the 
rest of mankind. It now spans four centuries and, as we enter the new millennium, we need to 
retell it, for if we can learn these lessons and build upon them, the whole of humanity will benefit 
in the new age which is now opening. American history raises three fundamental questions. First, 
can a nation rise above the injustices of its origins and, by its moral purpose and performance, 
atone for them? All nations are born in war, conquest, and crime, usually concealed by the 
obscurity of a distant past. The United States, from its earliest colonial times, won its title—
 deeds in the full blaze of recorded history, and the stains on them are there for all to see and 
censure: the dispossession of an indigenous people, and the securing of self—sufficiency through 
the sweat and pain of an enslaved race. In the judgmental scales of history, such grievous wrongs 
must be balanced by the erection of a society dedicated to justice and fairness. Has the United 
States done this? Has it expiated its organic sins? The second question provides the key to the 
first. In the process of nation—building, can ideals and altruism—the desire to build the perfect 
community—be mixed successfully with acquisitiveness and ambition, without which no 
dynamic society can be built at all? Have the Americans got the mixture right? Have they forged 
a nation where righteousness has the edge over the needful self—interest? Thirdly, the 
Americans originally aimed to build an other—worldly `City on a Hill,’ but found themselves 
designing a republic of the people, to be a model for the entire planet. Have they made good their 
audacious claims? Have they indeed proved exemplars for humanity? And will they continue to 
be so in the new millennium? <br><br>
We must never forget that the settlement of what is now the United States was only part of a 
larger enterprise. And this was the work of the best and the brightest of the entire European 
continent. They were greedy. As Christopher Columbus said, men crossed the Atlantic primarily 
in search of gold. But they were also idealists. These adventurous young men thought they could 
transform the world for the better. Europe was too small for them—for their energies, their 
ambitions, and their visions. In the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, they had gone east, seeking to 
reChristianize the Holy Land and its surroundings, and also to acquire land there. The mixture of 
religious zeal, personal ambition—not to say cupidity—and lust for adventure which inspired 
generations of Crusaders was the prototype for the enterprise of the Americas. <br><br>
In the east, however, Christian expansion was blocked by the stiffening resistance of the 
Moslem world, and eventually by the expansive militarism of the Ottoman Turks. Frustrated 
there, Christian youth spent its ambitious energies at home: in France, in the extermination of 
heresy, and the acquisition of confiscated property; in the Iberian peninsula, in the reconquest of 
territory held by Islam since the 8th century, a process finally completed in the 1490s with the 
destruction of the Moslem kingdom of Granada, and the expulsion, or forcible conversion, of the 
last Moors in Spain. It is no coincidence that this decade, which marked the homogenization of 
western Europe as a Christian entity and unity, also saw the first successful efforts to carry 
Europe, and Christianity, into the western hemisphere. As one task ended, another was 
undertaken in earnest. <br><br>
The Portuguese, a predominantly seagoing people, were the first to begin the new enterprise, 
early in the 15th century. In 1415, the year the English King Henry V destroyed the French army 
at Agincourt, Portuguese adventurers took Ceuta, on the north African coast, and turned it into a 
trading depot. Then they pushed southwest into the Atlantic, occupying in turn Madeira, Cape 
Verde, and the Azores, turning all of them into colonies of the Portuguese crown. The 
Portuguese adventurers were excited by these discoveries: they felt, already, that they were 
13<br><br>
bringing into existence a new world, though the phrase itself did not pass into common currency 
until 1494. These early settlers believed they were beginning civilization afresh: the first boy and 
girl born on Madeira were christened Adam and Eve.1 But almost immediately came the Fall, 
which in time was to envelop the entire Atlantic. In Europe itself, the slave—system of antiquity 
had been virtually extinguished by the rise of Christian society. In the 1440s, exploring the 
African coast from their newly acquired islands, the Portuguese rediscovered slavery as a 
working commercial institution. Slavery had always existed in Africa, where it was operated 
extensively by local rulers, often with the assistance of Arab traders. Slaves were captives, 
outsiders, people who had lost tribal status; once enslaved, they became exchangeable 
commodities, indeed an important form of currency. <br><br>
The Portuguese entered the slave—trade in the mid—15th century, took it over and, in the 
process, transformed it into something more impersonal, and horrible, than it had been either in 
antiquity or medieval Africa. The new Portuguese colony of Madeira became the center of a 
sugar industry, which soon made itself the largest supplier for western Europe. The first sugar—
 mill, worked by slaves, was erected in Madeira in 1452. This cash—industry was so successful 
that the Portuguese soon began laying out fields for sugar—cane on the Biafran Islands, off the 
African coast. An island off Cap Blanco in Mauretania became a slave—depot. From there, 
when the trade was in its infancy, several hundred slaves a year were shipped to Lisbon. As the 
sugar industry expanded, slaves began to be numbered in thousands: by 1550, some 50,000 
African slaves had been imported into Sao Tome alone, which likewise became a slave entrepot. 
These profitable activities were conducted, under the aegis of the Portuguese crown, by a mixed 
collection of Christians from all over Europe—Spanish, Normans, and Flemish, as well as 
Portuguese, and Italians from the Aegean and the Levant. Being energetic, single young males, 
they mated with whatever women they could find, and sometimes married them. Their mixed 
progeny, mulattos, proved less susceptible than pure—bred Europeans to yellow fever and 
malaria, and so flourished. Neither Europeans nor mulattos could live on the African coast itself. 
But they multiplied in the Cape Verde Islands, 300 miles off the West African coast. The mulatto 
trading—class in Cape Verde were known as Lancados. Speaking both Creole and the native 
languages, and practicing Christianity spiced with paganism, they ran the European end of the 
slave—trade, just as Arabs ran the African end.2 <br><br>
This new—style slave—trade was quickly characterized by the scale and intensity with which 
it was conducted, and by the cash nexus which linked African and Arab suppliers, Portuguese 
and Lancado traders, and the purchasers. The slave—markets were huge. The slaves were 
overwhelmingly male, employed in large—scale agriculture and mining. There was little attempt 
to acculturalize them and they were treated as body—units of varying quality, mere 
commodities. At Sao Tome in particular this modern pattern of slavery took shape. The 
Portuguese were soon selling African slaves to the Spanish, who, following the example in 
Madeira, occupied the Canaries and began to grow cane and mill sugar there too. By the time 
exploration and colonization spread from the islands across the Atlantic, the slave—system was 
already in place.3 <br><br>
In moving out into the Atlantic islands, the Portuguese discovered the basic meteorological fact 
about the North Atlantic, which forms an ocean weather—basin of its own. There were strong 
currents running clockwise, especially in the summer. These are assisted by northeast trade 
winds in the south, westerlies in the north. So seafarers went out in a southwest direction, and 
returned to Europe in a northeasterly one. Using this weather system, the Spanish landed on the 
Canaries and occupied them. The indigenous Guanches were either sold as slaves in mainland 
14<br><br>
Spain, or converted and turned into farm—labourers by their mainly Castilian conquerors.4 
Profiting from the experience of the Canaries in using the North Atlantic weather system, 
Christopher Columbus made landfall in the western hemisphere in 1492. His venture was 
characteristic of the internationalism of the American enterprise. He operated from the Spanish 
city of Seville but he came from Genoa and he was by nationality a citizen of the Republic of 
Venice, which then ran an island empire in the Eastern Mediterranean. The finance for his 
transatlantic expedition was provided by himself and other Genoa merchants in Seville, and 
topped up by the Spanish Queen Isabella, who had seized quantities of cash when her troops 
occupied Granada earlier in the year.5 <br><br>
The Spanish did not find American colonization easy. The first island—town Columbus 
founded, which he called Isabella, failed completely. He then ran out of money and the crown 
took over. The first successful settlement took place in 1502, when Nicolas de Ovando landed in 
Santo Domingo with thirty ships and no fewer than 2,500 men. This was a deliberate colonizing 
enterprise, using the experience Spain had acquired in its reconquista, and based on a network of 
towns copied from the model of New Castile in Spain itself. That in turn had been based on the 
bastides of medieval France, themselves derived from Roman colony—towns, an improved 
version of Greek models going back to the beginning of the first millennium BC. So the system 
was very ancient. The first move, once a beachhead or harbour had been secured, was for an 
official called the adelantana to pace out the streetgrid.6 Apart from forts, the first substantial 
building was the church. Clerics, especially from the orders of friars, the Dominicans and 
Franciscans, played a major part in the colonizing process, and as early as 1512 the first 
bishopric in the New World was founded. Nine years before, the crown had established a Casa 
de la Contracion in Seville, as headquarters of the entire transatlantic effort, and considerable 
state funds were poured into the venture. By 1520 at least 10,000 Spanishspeaking Europeans 
were living on the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean, food was being grown regularly and a 
definite pattern of trade with Europeans had been established.7 <br><br>
The year before, Hernando Cortes had broken into the American mainland by assaulting the 
ancient civilization of Mexico. The expansion was astonishingly rapid, the fastest in the history 
of mankind, comparable in speed with and far more exacting in thoroughness and permanency 
than the conquests of Alexander the Great. In a sense, the new empire of Spain superimposed 
itself on the old one of the Aztecs rather as Rome had absorbed the Greek colonies.8 Within a 
few years, the Spaniards were 1,000 miles north of Mexico City, the vast new grid—town which 
Cortes built on the ruins of the old Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.<br> <br>
    This incursion from Europe brought huge changes in the demography, the flora and fauna, and 
the economics of the Americas. Just as the Europeans were vulnerable to yellow fever, so the 
indigenous Indians were at the mercy of smallpox, which the Europeans brought with them. 
Europeans had learned to cope with it over many generations but it remained extraordinarily 
infectious and to the Indians it almost invariably proved fatal. We do not know with any 
certainty how many people lived in the Americas before the Europeans came. North of what is 
now the Mexican border, the Indians were sparse and tribal, still at the hunter—gatherer stage in 
many cases, and engaged in perpetual inter—tribal warfare, though some tribes grew corn in 
addition to hunting and lived part of the year in villages—perhaps one million of them, all told. 
Further south there were far more advanced societies, and two great empires, the Aztecs in 
Mexico and the Incas in Peru. In central and south America, the total population was about 20 
million. Within a few decades, conquest and the disease it brought had reduced the Indians to 2 
million, or even less. Hence, very early in the conquest, African slaves were in demand to supply 
15<br><br>
labor. In addition to smallpox, the Europeans imported a host of welcome novelties: wheat and 
barley, and the ploughs to make it possible to grow them; sugarcanes and vineyards; above all, a 
variety of livestock. The American Indians had failed to domesticate any fauna except dogs, 
alpacas and llamas. The Europeans brought in cattle, including oxen for ploughing, horses, 
mules, donkeys, sheep, pigs and poultry. Almost from the start, horses of high quality, as well as 
first—class mules and donkeys, were successfully bred in the Americas. The Spanish were the 
only west Europeans with experience of running large herds of cattle on horseback, and this 
became an outstanding feature of the New World, where enormous ranches were soon supplying 
cattle for food and mules for work in great quantities for the mining districts.9<br><br> 
The Spaniards, hearts hardened in the long struggle to expel the Moors, were ruthless in 
handling the Indians. But they were persistent in the way they set about colonizing vast areas. 
The English, when they followed them into the New World, noted both characteristics. John 
Hooker, one Elizabethan commentator, regarded the Spanish as morally inferior `because with 
all cruel inhumanity ... they subdued a naked and yielding people, whom they sought for gain 
and not for any religion or plantation of a commonwealth, did most cruelly tyrannize and against 
the course of all human nature did scorch and roast them to death, as by their own histories doth 
appear.’ At the same time the English admired `the industry, the travails of the Spaniard, their 
exceeding charge in furnishing so many ships ... their continual supplies to further their attempts 
and their active and undaunted spirits in executing matters of that quality and difficulty, and 
lastly their constant resolution of plantation."10 <br><br>
With the Spanish established in the Americas, it was inevitable that the Portuguese would 
follow them. Portugal, vulnerable to invasion by Spain, was careful to keep its overseas relations 
with its larger neighbor on a strictly legal basis. As early as 1479 Spain and Portugal signed an 
agreement regulating their respective spheres of trade outside European waters. The papacy, 
consulted, drew an imaginary longitudinal line running a hundred leagues west of the Azores: 
west of it was Spanish, east of it Portuguese. The award was made permanent between the two 
powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, which drew the lines 370 leagues west of Cape 
Verde. This gave the Portuguese a gigantic segment of South America, including most of what is 
now modern Brazil. They knew of this coast at least from 1500 when a Portuguese squadron, on 
its way to the Indian Ocean, pushed into the Atlantic to avoid headwinds and, to its surprise, 
struck land which lay east of the treaty line and clearly was not Africa. But their resources were 
too committed to exploring the African coast and the routes to Asia and the East Indies, where 
they were already opening posts, to invest in the Americas. Their first colony in Brazil was not 
planted till 1532, where it was done on the model of their Atlantic island possessions, the crown 
appointing `captains,’ who invested in land—grants called donatorios. Most of this first wave 
failed, and it was not until the Portuguese transported the sugar—plantation system, based on 
slavery, from Cape Verde and the Biafran Islands, to the part of Brazil they called Pernambuco, 
that profits were made and settlers dug themselves in. The real development of Brazil on a large 
scale began only in 1549, when the crown made a large investment, sent over 1,000 colonists and 
appointed Martin Alfonso de Sousa governor—general with wide powers. Thereafter progress 
was rapid and irreversible, a massive sugar industry grew up across the Atlantic, and during the 
last quarter of the 16th century Brazil became the largest slave—importing center in the world, 
and remained so. Over 300 years, Brazil absorbed more African slaves than anywhere else and 
became, as it were, an Afro—American territory. Throughout the 16th century the Portuguese 
had a virtual monopoly of the Atlantic slave trade. By 1600 nearly 300,000 African slaves had 
been transported by sea to plantations—25,000 to Madeira, 50,000 to Europe, 75,000 to Cape 
16<br><br>
Sao Tome, and the rest to America. By this date, indeed, four out of five slaves were heading for 
the New World." <br><br>
    It is important to appreciate that this system of plantation slavery, organized by the Portuguese 
and patronized by the Spanish for their mines as well as their sugar—fields, had been in place, 
expanding steadily, long before other European powers got a footing in the New World. But the 
prodigious fortunes made by the Spanish from mining American silver, and by both Spanish and 
Portuguese in the sugar trade, attracted adventurers from all over Europe. While the Spanish and 
Portuguese were careful to respect each other’s spheres of interest, which in any event were 
consolidated when the two crowns were united under the Habsburgs in 1580, no such inhibitions 
held back other nations. Any chance that the papal division of the Atlantic spoils between Spain 
and Portugal would hold was destroyed by the Reformation of the 1520s and 1530s, during 
which large parts of maritime northwest Europe renounced any allegiance to Rome. 
Protestantism took special hold in the trading communities and seaports of Atlantic France and 
the Low Countries, in London, already the largest commercial city in Europe, and among the 
seafaring men of southwest England. In 1561, Queen Elizabeth I’s Secretary of State, Sir 
William Cecil, carried out an investigation into the international law of the Atlantic, and firmly 
told the Spanish ambassador that the pope had had no authority for his award. In any case there 
had long been a tradition, tenaciously held by French Huguenot seamen, who dismissed Catholic 
claims on principle, that the normal rules of peace and war were suspended beyond a certain 
imaginary line running down the midAtlantic. This line was even more vague than the pope’s 
original award, and no one knew exactly where it was. But the theory, and indeed the practice, of 
`No Peace Beyond the Line’ was a 16th—century fact of life.’ It is very significant indeed that, 
almost from its origins, the New World was widely regarded as a hemisphere where the rule of 
law did not apply and where violence was to be expected. <br><br>
From the earliest years of the 16th century, Breton, Norman, Basque, and French fishermen 
(from La Rochelle) had been working the rich fishing grounds of the Grand Banks off 
Newfoundland and Labrador. Encouraged by their rich hauls, and reports of riches on land, they 
went further. In 1534 the French seafarer Jacques Cartier, from St Malo, went up the St 
Lawrence River, spent the winter at what he called Stadacona (Quebec) and penetrated as far as 
Hochelaga (Montreal). He was back again in 1541, looking for the `Kingdom of Saguenay,’ 
reported to be rich in gold and diamonds. But the gold turned out to be iron pyrites and the 
diamonds mere quartz crystals, and his expedition failed. As the wars of religion began to tear 
Europe apart, the great French Protestant leader Gaspard de Coligny, Admiral of France, sent an 
expedition to colonize an island in what is now the immense harbor of Rio de Janeiro. This was 
in 1555 and the next year 300 reinforcements were dispatched to join them, many picked 
personally by Jean Calvin himself. But it did not prosper, and in 1560 the Portuguese, seeing that 
the colony was weak, attacked and hanged all its inhabitants. The French also set up Huguenot 
colonies at Fort Caroline in northern Florida, and at Charles Fort, near the Savannah River, in 
1562 and 1564. But the Spaniards, whose great explorer Hernando de Soto had reconnoitered the 
entire area in the years 1539—42, were on the watch for intruders, especially Protestants. In 
1565 they attacked Fort Caroline in force and massacred the entire colony. They did the same at 
Charles Fort the next year, and erected their own strongholds at St Augustine and St Catherine’s 
Island. Six years later, in 1572, French Catholic militants staged the Massacre of St 
Bartholomew, in which Admiral Coligny was murdered, thus bringing to an end the first phase 
of French transatlantic expansion." 
17<br><br>
Into the vacuum left by the discomfiture of French Protestantism stepped the English, and it from 
their appearance on the scene that we date the ultimate origins of the American people. The 
Englishman John Cabot had been off the coast of Labrador as long ago as 1497, and off Nova 
Scotia the following year. Nothing came of these early ventures, but the English were soon 
fishing off the Banks in strength, occasionally wintering in Newfoundland. Henry VIII took 
many Huguenot seamen and adventurers into his service and under his daughter Elizabeth 
maritime entrepreneurs like Sir John Hawkins worked closely with French Protestants in 
planning raids on Spanish commerce `beyond the line.’ The West Country gentleman—seafarer 
Humphrey Gilbert helped the Huguenots to fortify their harbour—bastion of La Rochelle in 
1562, was made privy to their Atlantic schemes, and conceived some of his own. He came of a 
ramifying family clan which included the young Walter Ralegh, his half—brother, and their 
cousin Richard Grenville. In 1578 Gilbert obtained Letters Patent in which Queen Elizabeth 
signified her willingness to permit him to `discover and occupy’ such lands as were `not 
possessed by any Christian prince,’ and to exercise jurisdiction over them, `agreeable to the form 
of the laws and policies of England. He was in touch with various scholars and publicists who 
did everything in their power to promote English enterprise on the high seas. One was Dr John 
Dee, the Queen’s unofficial scientific adviser; another was the young mathematician Thomas 
Harlot, friend and follower of Ralegh. The most important by far, however, was Richard 
Hakluyt. <br><br>
Hakluyt was the son of a Middle Temple lawyer who had made a collection of maps and 
manuscripts on ocean travel. What his father followed as a hobby, young Hakluyt made his 
lifework. His countless publications, ranging from pamphlets to books, reinforced by powerful 
letters to the great and the good of Elizabethan England, were the biggest single impulse in 
persuading England to look west for its future, as well as our greatest single repository of 
information about the Atlantic in the 16th century. Young Hakluyt has some claims to be 
considered the first geopolitical strategist, certainly the first English speaking one. What Dr Dee 
was already calling the future `British Empire,’ and exhorting Queen Elizabeth to create, was to 
Hakluyt not a distant vision but something to be brought about in the next few years by getting 
seamen and entrepreneurs and `planters’ of ‘colonies’—two new words which had first appeared 
in the language in the 1550s—to set about launching a specific settlement on the American 
coast.` In 1582, Hakluyt published an account of some of the voyages to the northwest Atlantic, 
with a preface addressed to the popular young hero Sir Philip Sidney, who had already arranged 
with Gilbert to take land in any colony he should found. Hakluyt complained in it that the 
English were missing opportunities and should seize the moment: 
I marvel not a little that since the first discovery of America (which is now full forescore and ten 
years) after so great conquest and planting by the Spaniards and the Portingales there, that we of 
England could never have the grace to set fast footing in such fertile and temperate places as are 
left as yet unpossessed by them. But again when I consider that there is a time for all men, and see 
the Portingales’ time to be out of date and that the nakedness of the Spaniards and their long—
 hidden secrets are at length espied ... I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is 
that we of England may share and part stakes (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and 
Portingale in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered. <br><br>
Gilbert immediately took up Hakluyt’s challenge and set out with five ships, one of them 
owned by Ralegh, and 260 men. These included `masons, carpenters, smiths and such like 
requisites,’ but also `mineral men and refiners,’ indicating that Gilbert’s mind, like those of most 
of the early adventurers, was still focussed on gold. But he did not survive the voyage: his tiny 
18
ship, the Squirrel, which was only 110 tons, foundered—Gilbert was last glimpsed reading a 
book on deck, a typical Elizabethan touch." So Ralegh took his place and immediately secured a 
new charter from the Queen to found a colony. Ralegh is the first great man in the story of the 
American people to come into close focus from the documents, and it is worth looking at him in 
detail. <br><br>
Ralegh was, in a sense, a proto—American. He had certain strongly marked characteristics 
which were to be associated with the American archetype. He was energetic, brash, hugely 
ambitious, money—conscious, none too scrupulous, far—sighted and ahead of his time, with a 
passion for the new and, not least, a streak of idealism which clashed violently with his 
overweening desire to get on and make a fortune. He was of ancient family, but penniless, born 
in Devon about 1554 and `spake broad Devonshire until his dying day.’ He was, wrote John 
Aubrey, who devoted one of his Brief Lives to him, `a tall, handsome and bold man,’ with a lot 
of swagger, `damnably proud.’ His good looks caught the Queen’s eye when he came to court, 
for she liked necessitous youngsters from good families, who looked the part and whom she 
could `make.’ But what made her single him out from the crowd of smart—looking gallants who 
jostled for attention was his sheer brain—power and his grasp of new, especially scientific, 
knowledge. The court was amazed at his rapid rise in favor. As Sir Robert Naunton, an 
eyewitness, put it, `true it is, he had gotten the Queen’s ear at a trice, and she began to be taken 
with his elocution, and loved to hear his reasons to her demands. And the truth is, she took him 
for a kind of oracle, which nettled them all. Ralegh was one of the first young courtiers to make 
use of the new luxury, tobacco, which the Spaniards had brought back from America, and typical 
of the way he intrigued the Queen was his demonstration, with the help of a small pair of scales, 
of how you measured the weight of tobacco—smoke, by first measuring the pristine weed, then 
the ashes. His mathematical friend, Hariot, fed him new ideas and experiments with which to 
keep up the Queen’s interest." <br><br>
Ralegh was not just an intellectual but a man of action since youth, having fought with the 
Huguenots, aged fifteen, and taken part in a desperate naval action under his half—brother 
Gilbert. He had also been twice in jail for `affrays.’ But his main experience of action, which was 
directly relevant to the American adventure, was in Ireland. The English had been trying to 
subdue Ireland, and `reduce it to civility’ as they put it, since the mid—12th century. Their 
success had been very limited. From the very beginning English settlers who planted themselves 
in Ireland and took up lands to turn into English—style estates had shown a disturbing tendency 
to go native and join the `wild Irish.’ To combat this, the English government had passed a series 
of laws, in the 14th century, known as the Statutes of Kilkenny, which constituted an early form 
of apartheid. Fully Anglicized territory, radiating from Dublin, the capital, was known as the 
Pale, and the Irish were allowed inside it only under close supervision. The English might not 
sell the Irish weapons or horses and under no circumstances were to put on Irish dress, or speak 
the local Gaelic language, or employ ‘harpers and rhymers.’ Conversely the Irish were banned 
from a whole range of activities and from acquiring land in the Pale, and staying there overnight. 
But these laws were constantly broken, and had to be renewed periodically, and even so English 
settlers continued to ‘degenerate’ and intermarry with the Irish and become Irish themselves, and 
indeed foment and lead revolts against the English authorities. One such uprising had occurred in 
1580, in Munster, and Ralegh had raised a band of l00 footmen from the City of London and 
taken a ruthless part in suppressing it. He had killed hundreds of `Irish savages,’ as he termed 
them, and hanged scores more for treason, and had been handsomely rewarded with confiscated 
Irish lands which he was engaged in `planting.’ In the American enterprise, Ireland played the 
19<br><br>
same part for the English as the war against the Moors had done for the Spaniards—it was a 
training—ground both in suppressing and uprooting an alien race and culture, and in settling 
conquered lands and building towns. And, just as the money from the reconquista went into 
financing the Spanish conquest of the Americas, so Ralegh put the profits from his Irish estates 
towards financing his transatlantic expedition."<br> <br>
Ralegh’s colonizing venture is worth examining in a little detail because it held important 
lessons for the future. His first expedition of two ships, a reconnaissance, set out on April 27, 
1584, watered at the Canaries and Puerto Rico, headed north up the Florida Channel, and reached 
the Carolina Banks at midsummer. On July 13, they found a passage through the banks leading 
to what they called Roanoke Island, `And after thanks given to God for our safe arrival hither, 
we manned our boats and went to view the land next adjoining, and to take possession of the 
same, in the right of the Queen’s most excellent Majesty."‘ The men spent six weeks on the 
Banks and noted deer, rabbits, birds of all kind, and in the woods pines, cypress, sassafras, sweat 
gum and the highest and reddest cedars in the world.’ What struck them most was the total 
absence of any pollution: `sweet and aromatic smells lay in the air.’ On the third day they spotted 
a small boat paddling towards the island with three men in it. One of them got out at a point 
opposite the English ships and waited, `never making any show of fear or doubt’ as a party 
rowed out to him. Then: <br><br>
After he had spoken of many things not understood by us we brought him with his own good liking 
aboard the ships, and gave him a shirt, a hat and some other things, and made him taste of our wine 
and our meat, which he liked very well; and after having viewed both barks, he departed and went 
to his own boat again, which he had left in a little cove or creek adjoining: as soon as he was two 
bowshots into the water, he fell to fishing, and in less than half an hour he had laden his boat as 
deep as it could swim, with which he came again to the point of land, and there he divided his fish 
into two parts, pointing one part to the ships and the other to the pinnace: which after he had (as 
much as he might) requited the former benefits received, he departed out of our sight. 
There followed further friendly contact with the Indians, and exchanges of deerskins and 
buffalo hides, maize, fruit, and vegetables, on the one hand, and pots, axes, and tun dishes, from 
the ship’s stores, on the other. When the ships left Roanoke at the end of August, two Indians, 
Manteo and Wanchese, went with them. All were back in the west of England by mid—
 September, bringing with them valuable skins and pearls. Ralegh was persuaded by the detailed 
account of one of the masters, Captain Arthur Barlow, that the landfall of Roanoke was suitable 
for a plantation and at once began a publicity campaign, using Hakluyt and other scribes, to 
attract investors. He had just become member of parliament for Devonshire, and in December he 
raised the matter in the Commons, elaborating his plans for a colony. On January 6, 1585 a 
delighted Queen knighted him at Greenwich and gave him permission to call the proposed 
territory Virginia, after her. In April an expedition of seven ships, carrying 600 men, half of them 
soldiers, assembled at Plymouth. The fleet was put under the command of Ralegh’s cousin Sir 
Richard Grenville, with an experienced Irish campaigner, Ralph Lane, in charge of the troops. It 
carried aboard Harlot, as scientific expert. He had been learning the local language from the two 
Indians, and was given special instructions to make scientific measurements and observe flora 
and fauna, climate and geology. Also recruited was John White, England’s first watercolor—
 painter of distinction, who was appointed surveyor and painter, and a number of other 
specialists—an apothecary, a surgeon, and skilled craftsmen. <br><br>
    After various misadventures, some losses, prize—taking from the Spaniards, and quarreling 
between Grenville and Lane, the bulk of the fleet reached the Roanoke area in July. There they 
20<br><br>
discovered, and Hariot noted, one of the main difficulties which faced the early colonists in 
America. `The sea coasts of Virginia,’ Hariot wrote, `are full of islands whereby the entrance 
into the main land is hard to find. For although they be separated with divers and sundry large 
divisions, which seemed to yield convenient entrance, yet to our great peril we proved that they 
were shallow and full of dangerous flats." There are literally thousands of islands off the 
American coasts, especially in the region of the great rivers which formed highways inland, and 
early voyagers could spend weeks or even months finding their way among them to the 
mainland, or to the principal river—system. And when they occupied a particular island, relief 
and reinforcements expeditions often found immense difficulty in identifying it. Moreover, the 
topography of the coast was constantly changing. Ralegh’s Virginia lies between Cape Fear and 
Cape Henry, from latitude 33.50 to 36.56, mainly in what is now North Carolina, though a 
portion is in modern Virginia. The Carolina Banks, screening the Roanoke colony, are now 
greatly changed by wind and sea—action, though it is just possible to identify the 16th—century 
outlines. <br><br>
No satisfactory harbor was found, though a fort was built on the north of Roanoke Island. 
Lane was left with 107 men to hold it, while Grenville returned to England in August to report 
progress. On the return voyage, Grenville took a 300—ton Spanish vessel, the Santa Maria, 
which had strayed from the annual treasure convoy, and brought it into Plymouth harbor on 
October I8. The prize and contents were valued at £I5,000, which yielded a handsome dividend 
for all who had invested in the 1585 expedition. But the fact that Grenville had allowed himself 
to be diverted into commerce—raiding betrayed the confusion of aims of the Ralegh enterprise. 
Was its object to found a permanent, viable colony, with an eye to the long term, or was it to 
make quick profits by preying on Spain’s existing empire? Ralegh himself could not have 
answered this question; or, rather, he would have replied `Both,’ without realizing that they were 
incompatible. <br><br>
Meanwhile Lane had failed to find what he regarded as essential to a settlement, a proper 
harbor, had shifted the location of the colony, fallen foul of the local Indians and fought a 
pitched battle; and he had been relieved by a large expedition under Sir Francis Drake, which 
was cruising up the east coast of America after plundering the Spanish Caribbean. Lane was a 
good soldier and resourceful leader, but he knew nothing about planting, especially crop—
 raising. The colonists he had with him were not, for the most part, colonists at all but soldiers 
and adventurers. Hariot noted: `Some also were of a nice bringing up, only in cities or towns, and 
such as never (as I may say) had seen the world before.’ He said they missed their `accustomed 
dainty food’ and `soft beds of down and feathers’ and so were `miserable.’ They thought they 
would find treasure and `after gold and silver was not to be found, as it was by them looked for, 
had little or no care for any other thing but to pamper their bellies.’ Lane himself concluded that 
the venture was hopeless as the area had fatal drawbacks: `For that the discovery of a good mine, 
by the goodness of God, or a passage to the south sea, or some way to it, and nothing else can 
bring this country in request to be inhabited by our nation.’ Lane decided to bring his men back 
to England, while he still had the means to do so. The only tangible results of the venture were 
the detailed findings of Harlot, published in 1588 as A Briefe and true report of Virginia, and a 
number of high—quality watercolor drawings by White, now in the British Museum, which 
show the Indians, their villages, their dances, their agriculture, and their way of life. White also 
made a detailed map, and elaborate colored sketches of flora and fauna, including a Hoopoe, a 
Blue Striped Grunt Fish, a Loggerhead Turtle, and a plantain. 
21<br><br>
A further expedition of three ships set out for Roanoke on May 8, 1587, with 150 colonists 
abroad, this time including some women and children, and John White in charge as governor. 
His journal is a record of the expedition. Again there were divided aims, for Captain Simon 
Fernandez, master of the fleet, was anxious to engage in piracy and so quarreled with White. 
Roanoke was reached, and on August 18 John White’s daughter, Elenora, who was married to 
his assistant Ananias Dare, gave birth to a girl, who was named Virginia, `because this child was 
the first Christian born in Virginia.’ But there was more trouble with the Indians, and Fernandez 
was anxious to get his ships away to prey on the Spaniards while their treasure fleet was still on 
the high seas. So 114 colonists, including Elenora and little Virginia, sixteen other women, and 
ten children, were left behind while White sailed back with Fernandez to persuade Ralegh to 
send a back—up fleet quickly. White reached Southampton on November 8 and immediately set 
about organizing relief. But he found the country in the midst of what was to be its first global 
conflict, preparing feverishly to resist the Spanish invasion—armada, which was expected in the 
spring. All shipping was stayed by government order in English ports, to be available for 
defensive flotillas, and when Ralegh and Grenville got together eight vessels in Devon in March 
1588, with the object of equipping them for Roanoke, the Privy Council commanded Grenville 
`on his allegiance to forbear to go his intended voyage’ and to place them under the flag of Sir 
Francis Drake, to join his anti—Armada fleet. White’s attempt to set out himself, with two small 
pinnaces, proved hopeless.’ <br><br>
As a result of the Armada campaign and its aftermath, White found it impossible to get his 
relief expedition to Virginia until August 17, 1590. He anchored at Roanoke Island at nightfall, 
lit by the lurid flickers of a forest fire. He recorded: `We let fall our grapnel near the shore, and 
sounded with a trumpet and call, and afterwards many familiar English tunes and songs, and 
called to them friendly. But we had no answer.’ When they landed the next day, White found no 
sign of his daughter or granddaughter, or anyone else. Five chests were found, broken open, 
obviously by Indians. Three belonged to White himself, containing books, framed maps, and 
pictures with which he had intended to furnish the governor’s mansion, to be built in the new 
town he had planned and called Ralegh. They were all, he said, `rotten and spoyled with raine.’ 
They found three letters, `CRO,’ carved on a tree, and nearby the full word ‘Croatoan,’ on a post, 
`in fayre Capital letters.’ White had agreed with the colonists that, if forced to quit Roanoke, they 
would leave behind a carved signpost of their destination; and in the event of trouble they were 
to put a Maltese cross beside it. There was no cross. But all the other evidence—the defensive 
palisade and the cabins overgrown with weed—indicated a hasty departure. And where the 
colonists went to was never discovered, though White searched long and anxiously. But he failed 
to get to Croatoan Island, and whether the frightened colonists reached it can never be known. To 
this day, no further trace of the lost colony has ever been found. Ralegh himself tried to sail past 
Virginia in 1595, on his way home from a voyage to Guyana, and he sent another search—party 
in 1602. But nothing came of either attempt. The most likely explanation is that the colony was 
overwhelmed by Indians on their way from Roanoke to Croatoan, the males killed, the women 
and children absorbed into the tribe, as was the Indian custom. So the bloodline of the first 
Virginians merged with that of the Indians they intended to subdue. <br><br>
In 1625 Sir Francis Bacon, no friend of Ralegh—who in the meantime had been executed by 
King James I—wrote an essay, `On Plantations,’ in which he tried to sum up the lessons of the 
tragic lost colony. He pointed out that any counting on quick profits was fatal, that there was a 
need for expert personnel of all kinds, strongly motivated in their commitment to a long—term 
venture, and, not least, that it was hopeless to try to win over the Indians with trifles `instead of 
22<br>
treating them justly and graciously.’ Above all, back—up expeditions were essential: `It is the 
sinfullest thing in the world to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness; for besides 
the dishonour, it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons.’ <br><br>
There are two points which need to be added. First, as the historian A. L. Rowse has pointed 
out, the failure of the Roanoke colony may have been a blessing in disguise. Had it taken root, 
the Spanish would certainly have become aware of this English intrusion in a continent all of 
which they claimed. They would have identified its exact location and strength and have sent out 
a powerful punitive expedition, as they did against the French in Florida in the 1560s. At that 
stage in the game they were still in a military and naval position to annihilate any English 
venture on the coast. Moreover, they would almost certainly have built forts in the vicinity to 
deter further English ventures and have laid specific claim to the entire coast of what is now the 
eastern seaboard of the United States, and so made it much less likely that the English would 
have returned, after the turn of the 17th century and in the new reign of James I. James was 
anxious to be on peaceful terms with Spain and would, in those circumstances, have forbidden 
any more attempts to colonize Virginia. So English America might never have come into 
existence." <br><br>
Secondly, in listing the reasons why Roanoke failed, Francis Bacon omitted one important 
missing element. It was an entirely secular effort. It had no religious dimension. This was in 
accordance with Ralegh’s own sentiments. Though he was for form’s sake an oathtaking, 
church—attending Protestant, like anyone else who wanted to rise to the top in Elizabethan 
England, religion meant nothing to him. It is not even clear he was a Christian. It was darkly 
rumored indeed, by his enemies at the court, that he and his friend Harlot, and others of their 
circle, were ‘atheists’—though the term did not then necessarily imply a denial of God’s 
existence, merely a rejection of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity: in our terminology he was a 
deist of sorts. At all events, Ralegh was not the man to launch a colonizing venture with a 
religious purpose. The clergy do not seem to have figured at all in his plans. There was no 
attempt on his part to recruit God—fearing, prayerful men. <br><br>
In these respects Ralegh was unusual for an Elizabethan sea—venturer. Most of the 
Elizabethan seadogs were strict Protestants, usually Calvinists, who had strong religious motives 
for resisting Spanish dominance on the high seas and in the western hemisphere. Drake was 
typical of them: his family were victims of the papist persecution under Queen Mary, and Drake 
had been brought up in a Thames—side hulk in consequence, educated to thump his Bible and 
believe in double—predestination and to proselytize among the heathen and the benighted 
believers in Romish superstition. He held regular services on board his ships, preached sermons 
to his men, and tried to convert his Spanish prisoners. Next to the Bible itself, his favorite book 
was Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, that compendium of the sufferings of English Protestants who 
resisted the Catholic restoration under `Bloody Mary’ and died for their faith. Foxe’s vast book, 
published early in Elizabeth’s reign, proved immensely popular and, despite its size and expense, 
had sold over 10,000 copies before the end of it, an unprecedented sale for those times. It was 
not just a history of persecution: it also embodied the English national—religious myth, which 
had been growing in power in the later Middle Ages and came to maturity during the 
Reformation decades—the myth that the English had replaced the Jews as the Elect Nation, and 
were divinely appointed to do God’s will on earth. <br><br>
This belief in divine appointment was to become an important factor in American as well as 
English history, because it was transmitted to the western side of the Atlantic when the English 
23<br><br>
eventually established themselves there. At the origin of the myth was the widely held belief that 
the Christian faith had been brought to Britain directly by Joseph of Arimathea, on the express 
instructions of the Apostles. Some thought the agent was St Paul; others that Christ himself had 
paid a secret visit. It was through Britain that the Roman Empire had embraced the faith: for the 
Emperor Constantine had been British—his mother Helena was the daughter of the British King 
Coilus. So, wrote Foxe, `by the help of the British Army,’ Constantine `obtained ... peace and 
tranquillity to the whole universal Church of Christ.’ <br><br>
In the reign of Elizabeth the myth became a historical validation of England’s role in resisting 
the Counter—Reformation and the Continental supremacy of the Catholic Habsburgs. The Elect 
Nation had imperative duties to perform which were both spiritual and geopolitical. In the 
second year of the Queen’s reign, John Aylmer wrote in his An Harborow for faithful and true 
subjects that England was the virgin mother to a second birth of Christ: <br><br>
God is English. For you fight not only in the quarrel of your country, but also and chiefly in 
defence of His true religion and of His dear son Christ. [England says to her children:] `God hath 
brought forth in me the greatest and excellentest treasure that He hath for your comfort and all the 
world’s. He would that out of my womb should come that servant of Christ John Wyclif, who 
begat Huss, who begat Luther, who begat the truth.’ <br><br>
The most strident in proclaiming the doctrine of the English as the Chosen Race were the 
explorers and navigators, the seamen and merchant adventurers, and the colonizers and planters. 
It is they who gave the myth its most direct geopolitical thrust by urging England’s divinely 
appointed right to break open Spain’s doomed empire of the Scarlet Woman, the popish Whore 
of Babylon, and replace it with an English Protestant paramountcy. One of them, John Davys, 
put the new English ideology thus: <br><br>
There is no doubt that we of England are this saved people, by the eternal and infallible presence 
of the Lord predestined to be sent into these Gentiles in the sea, to those Isles and famous 
Kingdoms, there to preach the peace of the Lord; for are not we only set on Mount Zion to give 
light to all the rest of the world? It is only we, therefore, that must be these shining messengers of 
the Lord, and none but we!”  <br><br>
It is curious that this powerful religious motivation, so strongly marked in seafaring men and 
others involved in overseas ventures, was made so little use of by the Englishmen controlling or 
plotting the attempted settlement of North America in the closing decades of the 16th century 
and even in the first decade of the 17th century. But so it was. It is part of the larger mystery of 
why the English, and the French too for that matter, were still so reluctant to settle across the 
Atlantic a whole century after Columbus’ first discoveries, during which the Spanish and 
Portuguese created vast empires there and possessed themselves of enormous fortunes.<br> <br>
France was totally absorbed in a long and bitter religious—civil war until the 1590s, when the 
Protestant leader Henri IV reluctantly accepted conversion to Catholicism to end the struggle, 
and gave the Protestants tolerance by the Edict of Nantes of 1598. Once at peace, eager French 
minds quickly conceived geopolicies of European and global expansion. The English avoided 
civil war but in the 1590s and the first decade of the 17th century they were embroiled in 
desperate struggles to subdue the `wild Irish,’ which they finally achieved—for the moment—in 
the last year of old Elizabeth’s reign. Thereafter their colonial energies were absorbed with 
`planting’ the conquered country, especially Ulster, until then the wildest part of it. Early in the 
1600s Ulster was made the theater of the largest transfer of population ever carried out under the 
24<br><br>
crown—thousands of Scots Presbyterians being allocated parcels of confiscated Catholic land 
along a defensible military line running along the Ulster border: a line which is still 
demographically significant to this day and explains why the Ulster problem remains so 
intractable. This major Ulster planting took root because it was based on agriculture and centered 
round hard—working, experienced Scots lowland farmers who were also ready to take up arms 
to defend their new possessions. <br><br>
In transatlantic expeditions, however, the English maritime intellectuals like Ralegh, Hakluyt, 
and Hariot were still obsessed with the possibility of quick riches and refused to accept the 
paramount importance of food—growing capacity to any successful settlement. The Indians 
could and did grow food, especially maize, but not for cash. Once their own needs were satisfied 
there was little left over. Colonists had either to grow their own or be dependent on continuing 
supplies from England—that was the great lesson of Roanoke. And the only way to insure that 
settlers grew food systematically and successfully was to send them out as entire families. This 
emerged as the leading principle of English colonization. Hakluyt, in his practical book on 
planting, wrote in terms of commerce and trading posts. He even recognized that religion could 
be important and he accepted the need to grow food. But he did not discuss the need to send out 
independent families and he thought agricultural labor could be supplied by criminals, civil 
debtors, and the like, sent out to regain their freedom by work. <br><br>
The notion of using overseas colonies for getting rid of `human offal,’ as it was termed, was 
coming to be accepted. A generation before, Gilbert had thought of using persecuted and 
discontented papists as settlers, but did nothing about it. In the 1590s, increasingly, life in 
England was made hard for the Presbyterians and other Nonconformists, but to begin with they 
migrated to Calvinist Holland. Certainly, by the turn of the century, there were many ill—fitting 
groups in society for whom the new business of exporting humans seemed the obvious solution. 
Population was rising fast, the number of `sturdy beggars,’ as parliament referred to them, was 
growing. In 1598 the House of Commons laid down banishment beyond the realm as one 
punishment for begging. The same year the French founded their first overseas penal colony. It 
was only a matter of time before the English state recognized that North America had the answer 
to many social problems. <br><br>
Then too, international trade was increasing steadily. In the later Middle Ages trade outside 
Europe had been falling off as Europe’s own meager gold and silver mines became exhausted 
and the Continent was gradually stripped of its specie to pay for imports. The discovery by the 
Spanish of precious metals in the Americas had a profound effect on world trade. Once and for 
all, Europe became a money—economy. Merchants began to operate on an ever—increasing 
scale. The huge quantities of silver brought to Europe pushed up commodity prices, and since 
wages and rents lagged behind, those involved in commerce made handsome profits, built 
themselves grand houses, and upgraded their importance in society. As trade spread throughout 
the world, and its quantity rose, the importance of colonizing ventures to expand the system 
became obvious. And finally there was North Atlantic fishing, increasing all the time. By the 
turn of the century both English and French had semi—permanent fishing settlements off what is 
now Labrador, Newfoundland, and Canada. Sable Island in the Atlantic was the first French 
permanent post. They set up another at Tadoussac at the mouth of the Sanguenay River. Their 
great explorer—entrepreneur Samuel de Champlain came there in 1603 and his party moved into 
Acadia, Cape Breton Island, and Canada itself. In 1608 Champlain established Quebec. Much of 
this early French enterprise was conducted by Huguenots, though when the French crown took 
over in the 1620s, Catholic paramountcy was established. It was now the French, rather than the 
25<br><br>
Spanish, who caused forward—looking Englishmen uneasiness and spurred them to move out 
across the Atlantic themselves, before it was too late. 
All these threads began to come together in the early years of the 17th century. James I was 
keen on colonization, provided it could be carried out without conflict with either Spain or 
France. As in Elizabethan times, the method was for the crown to issue charters to `companies of 
adventurers,’ who risked their own money. The Ulster plantation, which began in earnest in 
1606, absorbed most of the available resources, but the same year the Virginia Company was 
refounded with a new charter. It had a Plymouth—based northern sector, and a southern sector 
based on London. The Plymouth men settled Sagadahoc on the Kennebec River, but abandoned 
it in 1608. A related, Bristol—based company founded settlements in southwest Newfoundland 
two years later. Meanwhile the Londoners followed up the old Roanoke settlement by entering 
the Chesapeake Bay in 1607 and marking out a city they called Jamestown, after their sovereign, 
40 miles up the Powhatan River, renamed the James too. <br><br>
The Jamestown settlement is of historic importance because it began the continuous English 
presence in North America. But as a colony it left much to be desired. This time, the men who 
ran the Virginia Company from London did not leave out the religious element, though they saw 
their divine purpose largely in terms of converting Indians. The company asserted that its object 
was `to preach and baptise into the Christian Religion and by propagation of the Gospell, to 
recover out of the arms of the Divell, a number of poure and miserable soules, wrapt up into 
death, in almost invincible ignorance.", The true benefits of colonization, wrote Sir George 
Peckham in a pamphlet, would accrue to the `natives,’ brought by the settlers `from falsehood to 
truth, from darkness to light, from the highway of death to the path of life, from superstitious 
idolatry to sincere Christianity, from the Devil to Christ, from Hell to Heaven.’ He added: `And 
if in respect of all the commodities [colonies] can yield us (were they many more) that they 
should but receive this only benefit of Christianity, they were more fully recompensed." 
There was also the `human offal’ argument. The New Britannia, published at the time of the 
Jamestown foundation, justified it by urging that `our land abounding with swarms of idle 
persons, which having no means of labor to relieve their misery, do likewise swarm in lewd and 
naughtie practises, so that if we seek not some ways for their foreign employment, we must 
supply shortly more prisons and corrections for their bad conditions. It is no new thing but most 
profitable for our state, to rid our multitudes of such who lie at home [inflicting on] the land 
pestilence and penury, and infecting one another with vice and villainy worse than the plague 
itself.’ <br><br>
Converting Indians, getting rid of criminals and the idle poor—that was not a formula for a 
successful colony. The financing, however, was right: this was a speculative company 
investment, in which individuals put their cash into a joint stock to furnish and equip the 
expedition, and reinforce it. The crown had nothing to do with the money side to begin with. 
Over the years, this method of financing plantations turned out to be the best one and is one 
reason why the English colonies in America proved eventually so successful and created such a 
numerous and solidly based community: capitalism, financed by private individuals and the 
competitive money—market, was there from the start. At Jamestown, in return for their 
investment, each stockholder received l00 acres in fee simple (in effect perpetual freehold) for 
each share owned, and another —100 acres when the grant was `seated,’ that is, actually taken 
up. Each shareholder also received a `head right’ of 50 acres for each man he transported and 
paid for. That was the theory. But in practice the settlers, who were adventurers rather than 
26<br><br>
farmers—most were actually company employees—did not know how to make the most of their 
acres. <br><br>
It was on May 6, 1607 that three ships of the Virginia Company, the Godspeed, the Discovery, 
and the Sarah Constant, sighted the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. The settlers numbered 105, and 
they built a fort, a church, and huts with roofs of thatch. None of the original settlement survives 
but an elaborate reconstruction shows us what it looked like, and it was extremely primitive. It 
was in fact more like a Dark Age settlement in western Europe during the 6th or 7th centuries 
than a neat township of log cabins—as though the English in establishing a foothold on the new 
continent had had to go back a thousand years into their past. As it was, lacking a family unit 
basis, the colony was fortunate to survive at all. Half died by the end of 1608, leaving a mere 
fifty—three emaciated survivors. <br><br>
The rest might have perished too had it not been for the leadership of Captain John Smith 
(c.1579—1631). Smith was a Lincolnshire man, who had had an adventurous career as a 
mercenary fighting the Turks. He Joined the Jamestown expedition not as an investor but as a 
hired soldier. His terms of engagement entitled him to a seat on the Jamestown council, set up 
immediately the colony was formed, but he was denied it for brawling on board ship. He 
accordingly spent the winter of 1607 mapping the Chesapeake Bay district. In the course of it he 
was taken by the Indians, part of a tribal grouping Thomas Jefferson was later to call the 
Powhatan Confederacy. He put this to good advantage by establishing friendly relations with the 
local inhabitants. When he returned to the colony he found it in distress. Since he was the only 
man who had a clear idea of what to do, he was elected president of the council in September 
1608, the earliest example of popular democracy at work in America. He imposed military 
discipline on the remaining men, negotiated with the Indians for sufficient food to get the colony 
through the winter, and in fact kept the mortality rate down to 5 per cent—a notable achievement 
by the standards of early colonization across the Atlantic. He got no thanks for his efforts. A 
relief convoy which arrived in July 1609 brought the news that changes in the company’s charter 
left him without any legal status. So he returned to England two months later. Smith continued to 
interest himself in America, however. In 1614 he conducted a voyage of discovery around the 
Cape Cod area, and published in 1616 A Description o f New England, which was to be of 
importance in the next decade—among other things, it was the first tract to push the term `New 
England’ into common use." <br><br>
Meanwhile Jamestown again came close to collapse. Under its new charter, the Virginia 
Company tried to recruit new settlers from all levels of society by promising them land free in 
return for seven years of labor. It attracted about 500 men and put them aboard the relief convoy, 
under a temporary governor, Sir Thomas Gates. Gates’ ship (one of nine) was wrecked off 
Bermuda, where he spent the winter of 1609—10, thus providing England’s first contact with a 
group of islands which are still a British crown colony at the end of the 20th century—and 
Shakespeare with his setting for The Tempest. The rest of the fleet deposited 400 new settlers at 
Jamestown. But, in the absence of both Smith and Gates, the winter was a disaster. When Gates 
and his co—survivors, having built two small ships in Bermuda—no mean feat in itself—finally 
arrived at Jamestown in May 1610, scarcely sixty settlers were still alive. All the food was eaten, 
there was a suspicion of cannibalism, and the buildings were in ruins. The Indians, moreover, 
seeing the weakness of the colony, were turning hostile, and it may be that a repetition of the 
Roanoke tragedy was pending. An immediate decision was taken to give up the colony, but as 
the settlers were marching downriver to reembark, a further relief convoy of three ships arrived, 
this time under the leadership of the titular governor of the Virginia Company, the grandee Lord 
27<br><br>
De La Ware (or Delaware as the settlers wrote it). Under his rule, and under his successor Gates, 
a system of law was established in 1611. <br><br>
We have here the first American legal code, what Gates called his ‘Lawes Divine, Moral and 
Martiall.’ They are known as `Dale’s Code,’ after his marshal, Thomas Dale, who had the job of 
enforcing them. Unlike Smith’s ordinances, they were civil not martial law, but they had a 
distinctly Puritan tone. Sabbath observance was strictly enforced, immodest dress was forbidden 
and idleness punished severely. The colony was not yet self—supporting even in food, however, 
and had nothing to export to England. But, the year after the code was promulgated, a settler 
called John Rolfe, fearing prosecution for idleness, began experiments with tobacco. After trying 
various seeds, he produced a satisfactory crop, the first sweet—tasting Virginian tobacco, and by 
1616 it was already exportable. In the meantime, in 1614, he had married an Indian princess, 
Pocahontas, who had been in and out of the colony since its inception, when she was twelve. The 
marriage produced offspring and many in Virginia to this day are proud of their descent from the 
princess. At the time the union produced a precarious peace with the local tribes.<br> <br>
The year 1619 was significant for three reasons. In order to make the Virginia colony more 
attractive to settlers, the company sent out a ship carrying ninety young, unmarried women. Any 
of the bachelor colonists could purchase one as a wife simply by paying her cost of 
transportation, set at 125 pounds of tobacco. Second, the company announced that it would give 
the colonists their `rights of Englishmen.’ A fresh governor, Sir George Yeardley, was sent out to 
introduce the new dispensation. On July 30, 1619 the first General Assembly of Virginia met in 
the Jamestown Church for a week. Presided over by Yeardley, flanked by his six fellow—
 councillors, constituting the government, it also included twenty—two elected burgesses.<br><br> They 
sat in a separate `House,’ like the Westminster Commons, and their first task was to go over 
Dale’s Code, and improve it in the light of experience and the popular will, which they did, 
`sweating and stewing, and battling flies and mosquitoes.’ The result of their deliberations was 
approved by Yeardley and his colleagues, constituting an Upper House, and both houses 
together, with the governor representing the King, made up a miniature parliament, as in England 
itself. Thus, within a decade of its foundation, the colony had acquired a representative 
institution on the Westminster model. There was nothing like it in any of the American colonies, 
be they Spanish, Portuguese or French, though some of them had now been in existence over a 
century. The speed with which this piece of legislative machinery had developed, at a time when 
its progenitor was still battling with King James and his theory of the divine right of kings, in 
London, was a significant portent for the future. <br><br>
Three weeks later, on August 20, John Rolfe recorded in his diary the third notable event of 
the year: `There came in a Dutch man—of—warre that sold us 20 negars.’ He did not state the 
price, but added that fifteen of the blacks were bought by Yardley himself, for work on his 
1,000—acre tobacco plantation in Flowerdew Hundred. These men were unfree though not, 
strictly speaking, slaves. They were `indentured servants.’ Theoretically they became free when 
their indentures expired at the end of five years. After that, they could buy land and enjoy all the 
rights of free citizens of the colony. White laborers arrived from England under the same terms, 
signing their indentures, or making their mark on them, in return for the passage to America. But 
in practice many indentured men acquired other financial obligations by borrowing money 
during their initial period of service, and thus had it extended. It is doubtful if any of this first 
batch of blacks from Africa ended up free farmers in the colony. Most white servants, when they 
struggled free of their indentures, found themselves tenant farmers on the Jamestown River. But 
it was not impossible for a black to become a free man in early Virginia: some are recorded as 
28<br><br>
having done so. What was more ominous, however, was the success with which Yeardley and 
other landowners used blacks to work their tobacco plantations. Soon they were buying more 
men, and not indentured laborers either, but chattel slaves. Thus in 1619 the first English colony 
in America embarked on two roads which bifurcated and led in two totally different directions: 
representative institutions, leading to democratic freedoms, and the use of slave—labor, the 
`peculiar institution’ of the South, as it was to be called. It is important to bear in mind that large 
numbers of black chattel slaves did not arrive in North America until the 18th century. All the 
same, the bifurcation was real, and it eventually produced a society divided into two castes of 
human beings, the free and the unfree. These two roads were to be relentlessly and 
incongruously pursued, for a quarter of a millennium, until their fundamental incompatibility 
was resolved in a gigantic civil war. <br><br>
    The very next year occurred the single most important formative event in early American 
history, which would ultimately have an important bearing on the crisis of the American 
Republic. This was the landing, at New Plymouth in what was to become Massachusetts, on 
December 11, 1620, of the first settlers from the Mayflower. The original Virginia settlers had 
been gentlemen—adventurers, landless men, indentured servants, united by a common desire to 
better themselves socially and financially in the New World. The best of them were men cast in 
the sturdy English empirical tradition of fair—mindedness and freedom, who sought to apply the 
common law justly, govern sensibly in the common interest, and legislate according to the 
general needs of the Commonwealth. They and their progeny were to constitute one principal 
element in American tradition, both public and private—a useful, moderate, and creative 
element, good for all seasons. The Mayflower men—and women—were quite different. They 
came to America not primarily for gain or even livelihood, though they accepted both from God 
with gratitude, but to create His kingdom on earth. They were the zealots, the idealists, the 
utopians, the saints, and the best of them, or perhaps one should say the most extreme of them, 
were fanatical, uncompromising, and overweening in their self—righteousness. They were also 
immensely energetic, persistent, and courageous. They and their progeny were to constitute the 
other principal element in the American tradition, creative too but ideological and cerebral, 
prickly and unbending, fiercely unyielding on occasions to the point of selfdestruction. These 
two traditions, as we shall see, were to establish themselves firmly and then to battle it out, 
sometimes constructively, occasionally with immense creative power, but sometimes also to the 
peril of society and the state. <br><br>
    The Mayflower was an old wineship, used to transport barrels of claret from Bordeaux to 
London. She had been hired by a group of Calvinists, all English and most of them from London, 
but including some who had been living in exile in Holland. Thirty—five of the settlers, who 
were led by William Bradford and William Brewster, were Puritan Nonconformists, dissenters 
whose Calvinist beliefs made them no longer prepared to submit to the episcopal governance and 
Romish teachings (as they saw it) of the established Church of England. They were going to 
America to pursue religious freedom, as a Christian body. In this sense they were not individuals 
but a community. They were also traveling as families, the first colony to sail out on this basis. 
They obtained from the Virginia Company an 80,000—acre grant of land, together with 
important fishing rights, permission to trade with the Indians, and authority to erect a system of 
self—government with wide powers. They brought with them sixty—six non—Puritans, and the 
settlers as a whole were grouped into forty—one families. Many carried books with them, in 
addition to a Bible for each family. The captain, Miles Standish, had Caesar’s Gallic War and a 
29<br><br>
History o f Turkie. There were enough beds, tables, and chairs carried on board to furnish a score 
of family huts, plus dogs, goats, sheep, poultry, and quantities of spices, oatmeal, dried meat and 
fish, and turnips. One passenger, William Mullins, brought with him 126 pairs of shoes and 113 
pairs of boots. Others, carpenters, joiners, smiths, and the like, brought their tools of trade. 
An important event occurred on the voyage, when the Mayflower was two months out from 
England, and the discomforts of a crowded voyage were leading to dissension. On November 21, 
the colony’s leaders assembled in the main cabin and drew up a social compact, designed to 
secure unity and provide for future government. In effect it created a civil body politic to provide 
`just and equal laws,’ founded upon church teaching, the religious and secular governance of the 
colony to be in effect indistinguishable. This contract was based upon the original Biblical 
covenant between God and the Israelites. But it reflected also early—17th—century social—
 contract theory, which was later to receive such notable expression in Thomas Hobbes’ 
Leviathan (1655) and John Locke’s Treatise of Civil Government (1690). It is an amazing 
document for these earnest men (and women) to have agreed and drawn up, signed by all forty—
 one `heads of households’ aboard the tiny vessel in the midst of the troubled Atlantic, and it 
testified to the profound earnestness and high—purpose with which they viewed their venture. 
    What was remarkable about this particular contract was that it was not between a servant and a 
master, or a people and a king, but between a group of like—minded individuals and each other, 
with God as a witness and symbolic co—signatory. It was as though this small community, in 
going to America together, pledged themselves to create a different kind of collective 
personality, living a new life across the Atlantic. One of their leaders, William Bradford, later 
wrote a history, Of Plymouth Plantation, in which he first referred to them as Pilgrims. But they 
were not ordinary pilgrims, traveling to a sacred shrine, and then returning home to resume 
everyday life. They were, rather, perpetual pilgrims, setting up a new, sanctified country which 
was to be a permanent pilgrimage, traveling ceaselessly towards a millenarian goal. They saw 
themselves as exceptions to the European betrayal of Christian principles, and they were 
conducting an exercise in exceptionalism. <br><br>
Behind the Pilgrims were powerful figures in England, led by Sir Robert Rich, Earl of 
Warwick, who in 1612 at the age of twenty—five had become a member of the Virginia 
Company, and was later to be Lord High Admiral of the parliamentary forces during the English 
Civil War. Warwick was an adventurer, the Ralegh of his age, but a graduate of that Cambridge 
Puritan college, Emmanuel, and a profoundly religious man. Together with other like—minded 
Puritan gentry, he wanted to reform England. But if that proved impossible he wanted the 
alternative option of a reformed colony in the Americas. Throughout the 1620s he was busy 
organizing groups of religious settlers, mainly from the West Country, East Anglia and Essex, 
and London—where strict Protestantism was strongest—to undertake the American adventure. 
In 1623 he encouraged a group of Dorset men and women to voyage to New England, landing at 
Cape Ann and eventually, in 1626, colonizing Naumkeag." John White, a Dorset clergyman who 
helped to organize the expedition, insisted that religion was the biggest single motive in getting 
people to hazard all on the adventure: `The most eminent and desirable end of planting colonies 
is the propagation of Religion,’ he wrote. `This Nation is in a sort singled out unto this work, 
being of all the States enjoying the liberty of the Religion Reformed, and are able to spare people 
for such an employment, the most orthodox in our profession.’ He admitted: `Necessity may 
oppress some: novelty draw on others: hopes of gain in time to come may prevail with a third 
sort: but that the most sincere and Godly part have the advancement of the Gospel for their main 
scope I am confident.’ 
30<br><br>
The success of this venture led to a third Puritan expedition in 1628 which produced the 
settlement of Salem. A key date was March 4, 1629 when the organizers of these voyages 
formed the Massachusetts Bay Company, under royal charter, which had authority to transfer 
itself wholly to the American side of the ocean. It promptly dispatched six ships with 350 people 
and large supplies of provisions, tools, and arms. But that was as nothing to a great fleet which 
set out in 1630, with 700 settlers aboard. This was the first of a great series of convoys, 
numbering 200 ships in all, which throughout the 1630s transported 20,000 Englishmen and 
women to New England. Thus in 1634 William Whiteway noted in his Dorchester diary: `This 
summer there went over to [New England] at least 20 sail of ships and in them 2,000 planters, 
from the ports of Weymouth and Plymouth alone.’ It was the greatest outward movement, so far, 
in English history. <br><br>
The most important of these early convoys, as setting a new pattern, was the one in 1630 
under the leadership of John Winthrop. He was the outstanding figure of the Puritan voyages, the 
first great American. Son of a Suffolk squire, and neighbor and friend of Warwick, he was tall 
and powerful, with a long, lugubrious, stern, impressive face, penetrating eyes, prominent nose, 
and high brow. He was another Cambridge man, trained as a lawyer in Gray’s Inn, sat as a 
justice of the peace, and took up a job in the Court of Wards but lost it because of his 
uncompromising Puritan views. He was a sad but exalted man, who had buried two beloved 
wives and reasoned to himself that `The life which is most exercised with tryalls and temptations 
is the sweetest and may prove the safest.’ He came to the conclusion that overcrowded, 
irreligious, ill—governed England was a lost cause, and New England the solution, setting his 
views down fiercely in his General Observations for the Plantation o f New England: 
All other Churches of Europe are brought to desolation and it cannot be but that the like judgement 
is coming upon us ... This land grows weary of its Inhabitants, so as man, who is the most precious 
of all Creatures, is heere more vile and base than the earth they tread upon ... We are grown to the 
height of intemperance in all excess of Ryot, as no mans estate almost will suffice to keep sayle 
with his equals ... The fountains of Learning and Religion are corrupted ... Most children, even the 
best wittes and fayrest hopes, are perverted, corrupted and utterly overthrowne by the multitude of 
evil examples and the licensious government of those seminaries. <br><br>
Previous colonies had failed, Winthrop argued, because they were `carnall not religious’. Only 
an enterprise governed in the name of the reformed religion stood a chance. 
Winthrop joined the new company at the end of July 1619, when it was decided that the 
proposed new colony should be self—governing and not answerable to the backers in England. 
Under their charter they had power to meet four times annually in General Courts, to pass laws, 
elect new freemen or members, elect officers, including a governor, deputy governor, and 
eighteen `assistants,’ make ordinances, settle ‘formes and Ceremonies of Government and 
Magistracy,’ and `correct, punish, pardon and rule’ all inhabitants of the plantation, so long as 
nothing was done `contrary to English. lawe.’ The decision to make the colony self—governing 
persuaded Winthrop to sell up his estate at Groton, realizing £5,760, and put all his assets into 
the venture. He impressed everyone connected with the venture by his determination and 
efficiency, and in October he was elected governor, probably because other major shareholders 
said they would not go except under his leadership. <br><br>
Winthrop proved extremely successful in getting people and ships together over the winter, 
thus forming the largest and best—equipped English expedition yet. As the fleet set off, on 
Easter Monday 1630, Winthrop was in a mood of exaltation, seeing himself and his companions 
taking part in what seemed a Biblical episode—a new flight from Egypt into the Promised Land. 
31<br><br>
To record it he began to keep a diary, just as he imagined Moses had made notes of the Exodus. 
These early diaries and letters, which are plentiful, and the fact that most important documents 
about the early American colonies have been preserved, mean that the United States is the first 
nation in human history whose most distant origins are fully recorded. For America, we have no 
ancient national myth or prescriptive legends but solid facts, set down in the matter—of—fact 
writings of the time. We know in considerable detail what happened and why it happened. And 
through letters and diaries we are taken right inside the minds of the men and women who made 
it happen. There can be no doubt then why they went to America. Among the leading spirits, 
those venturing out not in the hope of a quick profit but to create something new, valuable, and 
durable, the overwhelming thrust was religious. But their notions of religious truth and duty did 
not always agree, and this had its consequences in how they set about emigrating. <br><br>
    The original Pilgrim Fathers of Plymouth Rock were separatists. They thought the church back 
in England was doomed, irrecoverably corrupt, and they wanted to escape from it. They came to 
America in the spirit of hermits, leaving a wicked world to seek their own salvation in the 
wilderness. John Winthrop saw things quite differently. He did not wish to separate himself from 
the Anglican church. He thought it redeemable. But, because of its weakness, the redemptive act 
could take place only in New England. Therefore the New England colony was to be a pilot 
church and state, which would create an ideal spiritual and secular community, whose example 
should in turn convert and save the Old World too. He set out these ideas to his fellow—travelers 
in a shipboard sermon, in which he emphasized the global importance of their mission in a 
striking phrase: `We must consider that wee shall be as a Citty upon a Hill, the eyes of all people 
are upon us.’ Winthrop observed to his fellows, and set down in his diary, numerous Old 
Testament—style indications of godly favor which attended their voyage. Near the New England 
coast, `there came a smell off the shore like the smell of a garden.’ `There came a wild pigeon 
into our ship, and another small land—bird.’ He rejoiced at providential news that the Indians, 
within a range of 300 miles, `are swept away by the small—pox ... so God hath hereby cleared 
our title to this place.’ He warned the colonists of the coming harsh winter, telling them: `It hath 
been always observed here, that such as fell into discontent, and lingered after their former 
condition in England, fell into the scurvy and died." <br><br>
    The Winthrop—led reinforcement was the turning—point in the history of New England. He 
took over 1,000 colonists in his fleet, and settled them in half a dozen little towns ringing Boston 
harbor. In Boston itself, which became the capital, he built his town house, took a farm of 6oo 
acres, Ten Hills, on the Mystic River, and other lands, and he built a ship, Blessing of the Bay, 
for coastal trading. Throughout the 1630s more ships arrived, to make good losses, swell the 
community, and form new towns and settlements. <br><br>
The land God gave them, as they believed, was indeed a promised one. Of all the lands of the 
Americas, what is now the United States was the largest single tract suitable for dense and 
successful settlement by humans. The evidence shows that human beings function most 
effectively outdoors at temperatures with a mean average of 60—65 degrees Fahrenheit, with 
noon temperature 70 average, or a little more. Mental activity is highest when the outside 
average is 38 degrees, with mild frosts at night. It is important that temperature changes from one 
day to the next: constant temperatures, and also great swings, are unfavorable—the ideal 
conditions are moderate changes, especially a cooling of the air at frequent intervals. The 
territory now settled and expanded met these requirements admirably, with 40—70 degrees 
average annual temperatures, a warm season long enough to grow plenty of food, and a cold 
season severe enough to make men work and store up food for the winter. The rainfall averages 
32<br><br>
were also satisfactory. Until the development of `dry’ farming, wheat was grown successfully 
only if the rainfall was over 10 inches annually and less than 45: the average United States 
rainfall is 26.6, and east of the Appalachians, in the area of early settlement, it is 30 to 50 inches 
a year, almost ideal. Variations of rainfall and temperature were greater than those in Europe, but 
essentially it was the same general climate. Odd, then, that the English, who came to the 
Americas comparatively late, got their hands on those parts where Europeans were most likely to 
flourish. <br><br>
    Successive generations of settlers discovered that almost anything can be grown in America, 
generally with huge success. Central North America has the best soil in the world for growing 
regular food—crops. Only 40 per cent may be arable but it has the best combination of arable 
soil, natural transport, and exploitable minerals. The soil makes a remarkable variety of crops 
possible, and this is one reason why there has never been a famine in this area since Europeans 
arrived. The effect of the Ice Age glaciers on North America, which once covered New England, 
was to scrape some areas to the bare rock but to leave ample valleys with rich deposits. Thus the 
Connecticut Valley, soon penetrated by the English, proved the most fertile strip in New 
England, and became in time prodigiously rich not just in settlements but in colleges, publishing 
houses, and the first high—quality newspapers in the Americas. The colonists brought with 
them, in addition to livestock of all kinds, most of the valuable plants they grew. In New 
England, the Pilgrim settlers never made the mistake of the Jamestown people, of looking for 
gold when they should be growing crops to feed themselves. But they found maize, or `Indian 
Corn,’ a godsend. It yielded twice as much food per acre as traditional English crops. It was less 
dependent on the seasons, could be cultivated without plowing using the crudest tools, and even 
the stalks could be used as fodder. It was the ideal cheap and easy food for an infant colony and 
it is no wonder the corn—cob became a symbol of American abundance—as did the turkey, a 
native of North America which the Puritans found much to their taste. The settlers also 
discovered chestnuts, walnuts, butternuts, beech, hazel, and hickory nuts in abundance, and also 
wild plum, cherry, mulberry, and persimmon, though most fruit trees were imported. In addition 
to maize the colonists had pumpkins, squash, beans, rice, melons, tomatoes, huckleberries, 
blackberries, strawberries, black raspberries, cranberries, gooseberries, and grapes, all growing 
wild or easily cultivated. <br><br>
To European arrivals, the wildlife, once they learned to appreciate and hunt it, was staggering 
in its fecundity. The big game were the deer and the buffalo. But of great importance to settlers 
were the smaller creatures whose fur and skin could be exported: weasel, sable, badger, skunk, 
wolverine, mink, otter, sea—otter, beaver, squirrel, and hare. Then there were the fish and 
seafood. The waters of Northeast America abounded in them, and once the New England 
colonists built their own ships—as they began to do, with success, almost immediately—there 
was a never—ending source of supply. John Josselyn, in his New England Rareties, published in 
1672, lists over 200 kinds of fish caught in the area.<br><br> 
The mineral resources were without parallel, as the settlers gradually discovered. If we can 
look ahead for a minute, exactly 300 years after John Winthrop’s fleet anchored, the United 
States was producing, with only 6 percent of the world’s population and land area, 70 percent of 
its oil, nearly 50 percent of its copper, 38 percent of its lead, 42 percent each of its zinc and coal, 
and 46 percent of its iron—in addition to 54 percent of its cotton and 62 percent of its corn. What 
struck the first New Englanders at the time, however, was the abundance and quality of the 
timber, to be had for the simple effort of cutting it down. In western Europe in the early 17th 
century wood for any purpose, including fuel, was increasingly scarce and costly. The ordinary 
33<br><br>
family, which could not afford `sea coal,’ could never get enough of it. So the colonists fell on 
the wood with delight. Francis Higginson, minister to the settlers at Cape Ann, wrote in 1629: 
`Here we have plenty of fire to warm us ... All Europe is not able to make so great fires as New 
England. A poor servant here, that is to possess but 50 acres of land, may afford to give more 
wood for timber and fire as good as the world yields, than many noblemen in England can afford 
to do. Here is good living for those that love good fires."‘ William Wood, the first American 
naturalist, who explored the forests in the years 1629—32, and published his findings two years 
later in New England’s Prospects, delightedly listed all the varieties of trees available, virtually 
all of which could be used for furniture, though also for charcoal, dyes, and potash for soap. He 
too was amazed by the sheer quantity, as well he might be. It has been calculated that the original 
forests of what is now the United States covered 822 million acres in the early 17th century. This 
constituted a stand of marketable saw—timber of approximately 5,200 billion square feet. Early 
America was a timber civilization, growing out of its woods just as Anglo—Saxon England grew 
out of its primeval forests. In the first 300 years of their existence, the American people 
consumed 353 million acres of this huge area of forests, being over 4,075 billion square feet of 
saw—timber. Washington and Lincoln with their axes drew attention to the archetypal American 
male activity." <br><br>
The New Englanders fell upon this astonishing natural inheritance with joy. They were unable 
to decide whether the Indians were part of this inheritance or competitors for it. They developed, 
almost from the first, a patriarchal attitude towards the Indians, and the habit, to us distasteful, of 
referring to them as their children. It is true that the North American Indians, compared to the 
Indians of Central and parts of South America, were comparatively primitive. They were 
particularly backward in domesticating animals, one reason why their social organizations were 
slow to develop. That in turn helps to explain why their numbers (so far as we can guess them) 
were small compared to the Indians of the south. Being so few, and occupying so large and 
fertile an area, the Indians did not replenish their cultivated land—they had of course no animal 
manure—and moved on to fresh fields when it became exhausted. But their agricultural skills, at 
least in some cases, were not contemptible. The early French and Spanish explorers—Cartier and 
Champlain on the St Lawrence, De Soto on the Mississippi, Coronado in the southwest—all 
reported seeing extensive cornfields. Henry Hudson said the Indians built houses of bark and 
stored them with corn and beans for winter. When the first settlers reached the Ohio Valley they 
came across cornfields stretching for miles. In 1794 General Wayne said he had `never before 
beheld such immense fields of corn in any part of America, from Canada to Florida.’ 
There were wide differences between the various Indian peoples. Most of them farmed a little, 
and hunting and fighting tended to be suspended during planting and harvest. The Indians of the 
southwest, presumably because they had closer contact with the advanced Indians of South and 
Central America, irrigated their crops from reservoirs and had actual towns. The Pueblo Indians 
had permanent villages near their fields. The Iroquois villages were semi—permanent. The 
Indians the New Englanders came across were usually farmers. The settlers noted the way they 
cleared land of trees and grew corn and beans, pumpkins and squash; in some cased they 
imitated Indian methods, for instance in the use of fish—fertilizer. The Indians seem to have 
been low—grade farmers but produced at least a million bushels of crops a year, drying and 
storing. They also produced poor—quality tobacco. <br><br>
    In most cases the New Englanders began by following Indian practice in sowing, growing, and 
storing, but then improved on their methods. They also got from the Indians the white potato, 
which had arrived from Peru in South America, though this was surprisingly little eaten until the 
34<br><br>
Irish arrived in New Hampshire. Where the early New Englanders benefited most from the 
Indians was in taking over cleared fields, left unclaimed when the tribes were wiped out by 
smallpox. The early New England farm, cleared of trees, with rows of corn twined with beans 
arranged as vines, and with squash and pumpkins growing in between, was not very different 
from the fields of the Indians. William Bradford, for one, testified to the help the Pilgrims 
received from Indian example, especially in growing corn, ‘ye manner, how to set it, and after, 
how to dress & tend it.’ <br><br>
The importance of livestock was critical. All thrived, pigs especially. One of the earliest 
exports was barrels of pork. Flocks of sheep were soon common in Massachusetts and Rhode 
Island. The colonists raised hardy horses and exported them to the West Indies. They brought in 
seed for turnips, carrots, buckwheat, peas, parsnips, wheat, barley, and oats—all raised with 
success. New England apples were soon doing particularly well. One commentator, writing in 
1642, said they now `had apples, pears and quince tarts, instead of their former Pumpkin Pies.’ 
Apples were `reckoned as profitable as any other part of the Plantation." <br><br>
    New England farming standards were much higher than Indian ones but, by the best European 
standards, wasteful. All knowledgeable observers noted how the plentiful supply of land, and the 
shortage of labor, led to `butchering.’ One account said tillage was `weakly and insufficiently 
given; worse, ploughing is nowhere to be seen, yet the farmers get tolerable crops; this is owing, 
particularly in the new settlements, to the looseness and fertility of the old woodlands, which 
with very bad tillage will yield excellent crops."‘ Another claimed that New England farmers 
were `the most negligent ignorant set of men in the world. Nor do I know of any country in 
which animals are worse treated ... they plough cart and ride [horses] to death ... all the 
nourishment they are like to have is to be turned loose in a wood. Visitors were making the same 
complaints in the mid—18th century, though by then the supply of new land to take in was 
running out, at least on the eastern side of the Appalachians. <br><br>
The New Englanders were, on the whole, much less wasteful than the Virginians. Indeed, 
without tobacco it is doubtful whether the Virginia colony could have survived at all. Initially all 
the authorities, at home and abroad, were against tobacco farming, largely because King James I 
hated the `weed,’ thinking it `tending to general and new Corruption both of Men’s Bodies and 
Manners.’ Governor Dale actually legislated against it in 1616, ordering that only one acre could 
be laid down to tobacco for every two of corn. It proved impossible to enforce. By the next year 
tobacco was being laid down even in Jamestown itself, in the streets and market—place. Men 
reckoned that, for the same amount of labor, tobacco yielded six times as much as any other 
crop. It had a high cash value. Everything conspired to help it. It was grown close to the banks of 
many little rivers, such as the James, the York, and the Rappahannock. Every small plantation 
had its own riverside wharf and boat to get the crop to a transatlantic packet. Roads were not 
necessary. Land would yield tobacco only for three years: then a fresh set of fields had to be 
planted. But the real problem was labor—hence slavery. The increasing supply of cheap, high—
 quality slave—labor from Africa came (as the planters would say and believe) as a Godsend to 
America’s infant tobacco industry. So it flourished mightily. James I himself signaled his 
capitulation as early as 1619 when he laid a tax of a shilling in the pound (5 percent) on tobacco 
imports to England, though he limited the total (from Bermuda as well as Virginia) to 55,000 lb a 
year. But soon all such quantitative restrictions were lifted and tobacco became the first great 
economic fact of life in the new English—speaking civilization growing up across the Atlantic. It 
continued to be counted a blessing over four centuries until, in the fullness of time, President Bill 
35<br><br>
Clinton brought the wheel back full circle to the days of James I, and in August 1996 declared 
tobacco an addictive drug. <br><br>
New England had no such crutch as tobacco to lean on. It had to work harder, and it did. Under 
John Winthrop, whose first spell as governor lasted 1630—4, it got the kind of firm, even harsh, 
government a new colony needs. In effect it was a theocracy. This meant that government was 
conducted by men chosen by all the full members of the congregation. These were the freemen, 
and they were recruited in batches on account of their `Godly behaviour.’ Thus in May 1631 
Winthrop added 118 men to the freeman ranks. More were added from time to time as he and the 
congregational elders saw fit. In effect, he ran a dictatorship. He summoned his General Court 
only once a year, not four times as the company’s charter stipulated. Everyone, not just the 
freemen, had to swear an oath of loyalty to his government. He was quite ruthless in dealing with 
any kind of dissent or (as he saw it) antisocial behavior. In August 1630, in the first weeks of the 
settlement, he burned down the house of Thomas Morton of Boston for erecting a maypole and 
`revelling.’ Morton was kept in the stocks until he could be shipped home in the returning fleet. 
The following June, Philip Radcliffe was whipped and had both his ears cut off for, in the words 
of Winthrop’s Journal, `most foul, scandalous invectives against our church and government.’ 
Sir Christopher Gardiner was banished for bigamy and papism. Again, `Thomas Knower was sett 
in the bilbowes for threatening the Court that, if hee should be punished, hee would have it tryed 
in England whether hee were lawfully punished or not. <br><br>
However, Winthrop was not the only man in New England who had a lust for authority and a 
divine mandate to exercise it. The new American colonies were full of such people. James I 
pettishly but understandably remarked that they were `a seminary for a fractious parliament.’ 
Men with strong religious beliefs tend to form into two broad categories, and constitute churches 
accordingly. One category, among whom the archtetypal church is the Roman Catholic, desire 
the certitude and tranquility of hierarchical order. They are prepared to entrust religious truth to a 
professional clergy, organized in a broadbased triangle of parish priests, with an episcopal 
superstructure and a pontifical apex. The price paid for this kind of orthodox order is 
clericalism—and the anticlericalism it provokes. There was never any chance of this kind of 
religious system establishing itself in America. If there was one characteristic which 
distinguished it from the startwhich made it quite unlike any part of Europe and constituted its 
uniqueness —in fact—it was the absence of any kind of clericalism. Clergymen there were, and 
often very good ones, who enjoyed the esteem and respect of their congregations by virtue of 
their piety and preachfulness. But whatever nuance of Protestantism they served, and including 
Catholic priests when they in due course arrived, none of them enjoyed a special status, in law or 
anything else, by virtue of their clerical rank. Clergy spoke with authority from their altars and 
pulpits, but their power ended at the churchyard gate; and even within it congregations exercised 
close supervision of what their minister did, or did not, do. They appointed; they removed. In a 
sense, the clergy were the first elected officials of the new American society, a society which to 
that extent had a democratic element from the start—albeit that such electoral colleges were 
limited to the outwardly godly. <br><br>
Hence Americans never belonged to the religious category who seek certainty of doctrine 
through clerical hierarchy: during the whole of the colonial period, for instance, not a single 
Anglican bishop was ever appointed to rule flocks there. What most Americans did belong to 
was the second category: those who believe that knowledge of God comes direct to them through 
the study of Holy Writ. They read the Bible for themselves, assiduously, daily. Virtually every 
36<br><br>
humble cabin in Massachusetts colony had its own Bible. Adults read it alone, silently. It was 
also read aloud among families, as well as in church, during Sunday morning service, which 
lasted from eight till twelve (there was more Bible—reading in the afternoon). Many families 
had a regular course of Bible—reading which meant that they covered the entire text of the Old 
Testament in the course of each year. Every striking episode was familiar to them, and its 
meaning and significance earnestly discussed; many they knew by heart. The language and lilt of 
the Bible in its various translations, but particularly in the magnificent new King James version, 
passed into the common tongue and script. On Sunday the minister took his congregation 
through key passages, in carefully attended sermons which rarely lasted less than an hour. But 
authority lay in the Bible, not the minister, and in the last resort every man and woman decided 
`in the light which Almighty God gave them’ what the Bible meant. <br><br>
This direct apprehension of the word of God was a formula for religious excitement and 
exaltation, for all felt themselves in a close, daily, and fruitful relationship with the deity. It 
explains why New England religion was so powerful a force in people’s lives and of such direct 
and continuing assistance in building a new society from nothing. They were colonists for God, 
planting in His name. But it was also a formula for dissent. In its origins, Protestantism itself was 
protest, against received opinion and the exercise of authority. When the religious monopoly of 
the Roman Catholic Church began to disintegrate, in the 1520s and 1530s, what replaced it, from 
the start, was not a single, purified, and reformed faith but a Babel of conflicting voices. In the 
course of time and often by the use of secular force, several major Protestant bodies emerged: 
Calvinism in Geneva and Holland; Anglicanism in England; Lutheranism in northern Germany. 
But many rapidly emerging sects were left outside these state churches, and more emerged in 
time; and the state churches themselves splintered at the edges. And within each church and sect 
there were voices of protest, antinomians as they were called—those who refused to accept 
whatever law was laid down by the duly constituted authorities in the church they belonged to, or 
who were even against the idea of authority in any form. <br><br>
We come here to the dilemma at the heart of the perfect Protestant society, such as the 
Pilgrims and those who followed them wished to create. To them, liberty and religion were 
inseparable, and they came to America to pursue both. To them, the Roman church, or the kind 
of Anglicanism Charles I and his Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, were creating in 
England, were the antithesis of liberty, the essence of thraldom. They associated liberty with 
godliness because without liberty of conscience godliness was unattainable. But how to define 
liberty? When did the exercise of liberty become lawlessness? At what point did freedom of 
conscience degenerate into religious anarchy? All the leaders of opinion in New England tackled 
this point. Most of them made it clear that liberty had, in practice, to be narrowly defined. 
Nathaniel Ward, who came to Massachusetts Bay in 1634 and became pastor of Ipswich, wrote a 
tract he entitled The Simple Cobbler of Aggawam in America, and boldly asserted: `I dare take it 
upon me to be the herald of New England so far as to proclaim to the world, in the name of our 
colony, that all Familists, Antinomians, Anabaptists and other enthusiasts shall have free liberty 
to keep away from us; and such as will come, to be gone as fast as they can, the sooner the better 
... I dare aver that God does nowhere in his world tolerate Christian states to give toleration to 
such aversaries of his truth, if they have power in their hands to suppress them.", John Winthrop 
himself gave what he termed a `little speech,’ on July 3, 1645, on the whole vexed question of 
the authority of magistrates and liberty of the people—a statement of view which many found 
powerful, so that the words were copied and recopied and eventually anthologized. Man, he laid 
down, had: 
37<br><br>
a liberty to that only which is good, just and honest ... This liberty is maintained and exercised in a 
way of subjection to authority, it is of the same kind of liberty whereof Christ hath made us free ... 
If you stand for your natural, corrupt liberties, and will do what is good in your own eyes, you will 
not endure the least weight of authority ... but if you will be satisfied to enjoy such civil and lawful 
liberties, such as Christ allows you, then you will quietly and cheerfully submit under that 
authority which is set over you ... for your good. <br><br>
    That was all very well in theory. But the difficulty of applying it in practice was illustrated by 
the vicissitudes of Winthrop’s own career, as a political and religious leader of the colony. It is 
early American history in microcosm. Winthrop had natural authority, a kind of charisma: that is 
why he had been picked as governor in the first place. But his stern and at times brutal exercise 
of it led strong—minded spirits—and there were plenty of them in the Bay Colony—to feel he 
had exceeded its legitimate bounds. <br><br>
    Moreover, in what Winthrop no doubt felt was a justified stratagem, such as Joshua and David 
and Solomon had indulged in from time to time, he had cheated. He obliged all colonists, 
including non—freemen, to swear an oath of loyalty to his government, in accordance with the 
charter. But, according to the charter, the General Court should meet four times a year, and 
Winthrop called it only once. After four years of what some called his `tyranny,’ many colonists, 
freemen and non—freemen alike, demanded he show them the charter, to see what it said. He 
reluctantly did so. It was generally agreed he had acted ultra vires. The colonists brought with 
them from England a strong sense of the need to live under the rule of law, not of powerful 
individuals. That was what the developing struggle in the English parliament was all about. The 
colonists had been promised, by the founding company of Massachusetts, all `the rights of 
Englishmen.’ Winthrop, no doubt from high motives, had taken some of those rights from them, 
by flouting the charter. So he was publicly deposed at a general meeting. The freemen of the 
colony set up what was in effect a representative system of government, with each little town 
sending deputies `who should assist in making laws, disposing of lands etc.’ This body 
confirmed Winthrop’s dismissal, and replaced him with his deputy, Thomas Dudley. Thus the 
first political coup in the history of North America was carried out, in 1634, when the colony 
was still in its infancy. And it was carried out not by force of swords and firearms but by 
arguments and speeches, and in accordance with the rule of law. <br><br>
However, the colonists soon discovered that to change a government by popular mandate does 
not necessarily mean to improve it. During the next three years, 1634—7, the colony was shaken 
by a series of arguments over rebellious and antinomian figures, such as Roger Williams and 
Anne Hutchinson. We will come to these two in a minute, because they are important in their 
own right. From the point of view of good government, they needed to be handled with a mixture 
of firmness, common sense, and fairness. The feeling grew in the colony that Winthrop’s 
successors lacked all three. Some felt that the authorities were becoming antinomian themselves. 
It was a fact that the church in Boston itself tended to be antinomian, all the rest orthodox. The 
antinomians held that the only thing which mattered in religion was the inner light of faith, 
which was a direct gift of God’s grace. The more orthodox held that good works and exemplary 
behavior were also necessary, and were visible, outward evidence of true faith and godliness. 
This argument was raging in England and Holland and other countries where Calvinism was 
strong. But it was fiercer in Massachusetts than anywhere. One contemporary wrote: `It began to 
be as common here to distinguish between men, by being under a Covenant of Grace or a 
Covenant of Works, as in other countries between Protestants and Papists.’ 
38<br><br>
The argument came to a head in the first contested election on American soil, May 17, 1637, 
an important date in the development of American democracy. The issue was religious; but 
behind it was the question of good, orderly government. If the antinomians had their way, it was 
argued, religion and government would cease to be based on reasoned argument, and learning, 
and the laws of evidence, and would come to rest entirely on heightened emotion—a form of 
continuous revivalism with everyone claiming to be inspired by the Holy Spirit. The issue was 
settled at a crowded outdoor meeting in Cambridge. `There was a great danger of a tumult that 
day. [The antinomians] grew into fierce speeches; and some laid hands on others; but seeing 
themselves too weak [in numbers], they grew quiet. Winthrop was triumphantly reelected 
governor, the antinomians being `quite left out’ in the voting. So from 1637 Winthrop was free to 
resume his clear and insistent policy of imposing orthodoxy on the colony by punishment, 
exclusion, and banishment. <br><br>
But doctrinal orthodoxy was the not the only measure of a man’s fitness to govern, as 
Winthrop learned to his cost. His natural authority was based to some extent on his descent from 
the old squirearchy of England, and his manifest possession of means to keep up his station in 
the New World. In 1639, however, Winthrop discovered that his English agent had cheated him, 
and that his affairs were in a muddle. The agent was convicted of fraud and sentenced to have his 
ears cut off. But that did not get the governor out of his financial difficulties. He found himself 
£2,600 in debt—a formidable sum—and was forced to sell land on both sides of the Atlantic. His 
financial plight became obvious. Friends and political supporters rallied round. They collected 
£500 to tide him over. They donated 3,000 acres to his wife. But Winthrop’s opponents pointed 
fingers. The Puritans did not exactly insist that poverty was a sign of wickedness. But there was 
a general assumption that the godly flourished and that if a man persistently failed to prosper—or 
if financial catastrophe suddenly struck him—it was because he did not, for some reason, enjoy 
God’s favor. This idea was very potent and passed into the mainstream of American social 
consciousness. Winthrop was its first victim. In 1640 he was demoted to deputy governor. Some 
purists even proposed to ban him, and another unsuccessful man, from office for life, `because 
they werte growne poor.’ But this measure did not pass. <br><br>
Indeed, Winthrop struggled back into the governorship two years later, when his earthly 
fortunes revived a little. Embittered and soured by his political vicissittude and `the unregeneracy 
of man,’ he dealt ever more severely with dissenters. He fell foul of an unorthodox preacher 
called Samuel Gorton, and commanded him to shut up or leave the colony. Gorton’s 
congregation sent a `weird and impudent letter’ to the Massachusetts government, comparing the 
Blessed Samuel to Christ and Winthrop to Pontius Pilate—it referred to him as `the Great and 
Honoured Idol General, now set up in Massachusetts’ and to his supporters as `a Generation of 
Vipers.’ Almost beside himself with rage at these `horrible and detestable blasphemies, against 
God and all Magistry,’ Winthrop sent three commissions of forty soldiers to arrest them. He had 
them tried and put in irons, but they continued preaching, until he took off their shackles and 
simply dispatched them into the wilderness.’ As a result of this high—handedness, Winthrop was 
again demoted to deputy governor in 1644. He wrote in his journal that he feared rule by the 
rabble, an actual democracy, `the meanest and worst of all forms of government.’ The amount of 
arguing and political maneuvering was intense. Early Massachusetts was a remarkably 
argumentative and politically conscious society—reflecting of course the Civil War then raging 
in England, which was a battle of words as well as arms. Winthrop published a treatise defending 
his actions, saying that a wise magistrate had no alternative but to stamp out a firebrand like 
Gorton before he set fire to the whole house. He said that wise men had to be given discretionary 
39<br><br>
power to follow God’s law as they saw it. One of the deputies attacked this view as outrageous: 
he said the tract should be `burnt under the gallows’ and added that `if some other of the 
magistrates had written it, it would have cost him his ears, if not his head.’’’ But Winthrop 
survived this controversy too, won back public favor, regained the governorship in 1646, and 
held it to his death three years later. <br><br>
Winthrop’s career and views raised fundamental issues at the time, which have continued to 
reverberate through American history and political discourse. Where does freedom end and 
authority begin? What was the role of the magistrate? And how should he combine the need for 
order and the commands of justice with the Christian virtue of mercy? There is no doubt that 
Winthrop himself thought deeply about these issues, communing and agonizing with himself in 
his journal. Generations of American historians have been sharply divided on his civic merits. In 
the 1830s, George Bancroft depicted him as a pioneer in laying down representative government 
in America. Later in the century Brooks Adams and Charles Francis Adams emphasized his 
authoritarian character and his propensity to persecute intellectual opponents—blaming him for 
the bigotry in the colony which later produced the witchhunting catastrophe in Salem. In the 
1930s Perry Miller and Samuel Eliot Morison stressed that Winthrop was a man of religion first, 
that his political philosophy was a projection of his Christian beliefs, thus indicating to what 
extent New England was a kind of theocracy, a deliberate attempt to erect a system of 
government in conformity with Christ’s teaching. Yet another historian, Edmund Morgan, went 
further and argued that Winthrop’s magistracy was a continuing struggle, in fashioning this 
Christian—utopian society, to prevent the separatist impulse, so strong among New England 
settlers from undermining corporate responsibility, and instead to harness the colonists’ sense of 
righteousness to the cause of social justice. <br><br>
Winthrop emerges from the chronicle of events as a severe and often intolerant man, and that 
is how his critics saw him. He regarded himself as a man chosen by God and the people to create 
a new civil society from nothing by the light of his religious beliefs, and he prayed earnestly to 
discharge this mandate virtuously. He admitted his shortcomings, at any rate to himself. His 
political theory was clear. Man had liberty not to do what he liked—that was for the beasts—but 
to distinguish between good and evil by studying God’s commands, and then to do `that only 
which is good.’ If, by God’s grace, you were given this liberty, you had a corresponding duty to 
obey divinely sanctioned authority. In the blessed colony of Massachusetts, freemen chose their 
rulers. But, once chosen, the magistrate’s word must be obeyed—it was divine law as well as 
man’s. If his commands were not just and honest, his authority was not genuine, `but a distemper 
thereof.’ Man was sinful, and struggling with his sinful nature. So sometimes magistrates had to 
exercise mercy and forgiveness. But, equally, final impenitence and stiff—necked obstinacy in 
sin had to be deal with ruthlessly. Conversely, the people should forgive magistrates their 
occasional errors of judgment. And if these errors were persisted in, then the people had the right 
of removal. Winthrop could claim that he was freely elected governor of the colony, not just 
once but four times, and that therefore he embodied representative government. Moreover it has 
to be said, on his behalf, that he implanted this system of government firmly in American soil, so 
that at the end of twenty years the colony had been built up from nothing to a body politic which 
was already showing signs of maturity, in that it was reconciling the needs of authority with the 
needs of liberty. <br><br>
The success of the Bay Colony in this respect would not have been possible without the sheer 
space America afforded. America had the liberty of vast size. That was a luxury denied to the 
English; the constraints of their small island made dissent a danger and conformity a virtue. That 
40<br><br>
indeed was why English settlers came to America. A man could stand on Cape Cod with his face 
to the sea and feel all the immensity of the Atlantic Ocean in front of him, separating him, like a 
benevolent moat, from the restrictions and conformities of narrow Europe. And, equally, he 
could feel behind him—and, if he turned round, see it—the immensity of the land, undiscovered, 
unexplored, scarcely populated at all, a huge, experimental theater of liberty. In a way, the most 
important political fact in American history is its grandeur and its mystery. For three centuries, 
almost until 1900, there were crucial things about the interior of America which were unknown 
to its inhabitants. But what they were sure of, right from the start, was that there was a lot of it, 
and that it was open. Here was the dominant geopolitical fact which bore down upon the settlers 
from their first days on the new continent: if they did not like the system they found on the coast, 
and if they had the courage, they could go on. Nothing would stop them, except their own fear. 
This was the point made by Roger Williams (1603—83), the second great American to emerge. 
Williams was a Londoner, of Welsh descent, who was ordained a minister in 1628 and came to 
the Bay Colony three years later. His original intention was to be an Indian missionary. Instead 
he became pastor in Salem. He was clever, energetic, and public—spirited, and promptly made 
himself a well—known figure in local society. Whereas Winthrop stood for the authority—
 principle, Williams represented the liberty—principle, though curiously enough the two men 
liked and respected each other. Williams loved the vastness of the New World and took the 
opportunity to explore the hinterland of the Bay. He liked the Indians, made contact with them, 
established friendships. He tried to learn their tongue; or, as he quickly discovered, tongues. In 
the early 17th century the 900,000 or so Indians of what is now the United States and Canada 
were divided by speech into eight distinctive linguistic groups, all unrelated, which in turn 
branched out into fifty—three separate stocks and between 200 and 300 individual languages. Of 
these, the most widely spoken, used by about 20 percent of all Indians, was Algonquilian. 
Williams learned this, and noted other Indian languages, and eventually published his findings in 
A Key into the Languages o f America (1643), the first and for long the only book written on the 
subject.,’ His friendships with individual Indians led him to conclude that there was something 
fundamentally wrong with settler—Indian relationships. The Europeans had come to bring 
Christianity to the Indians, and that was right, thought Williams. Of all the things they had to 
impart to the heathen, that was the most precious blessing—far more important than horses and 
firearms, which some settlers were keen to sell, and all Indians anxious to buy. But in practice, 
Williams found, few New Englanders took trouble to instruct Indians in Christianity. What they 
all wanted to do was to dispossess them of their lands and traditional hunting preserves, if 
possible by sheer robbery. Williams thought this profoundly unChristian. He argued that all title 
to Indian land should be validated by specific negotiations and at an agreed, fair price. Anything 
less was sinful. <br><br>
None of this made Williams popular among right—thinking freemen of Boston. But his 
religious views, and their political consequences, were far more explosive. He did not believe, as 
Winthrop’s Anglicans held, and as even the Pilgrim Fathers had accepted, that God covenanted 
with a congregation or an entire society. God, he held, covenanted with each individual. The 
logic of this was not merely that each person was entitled to his own interpretation of the truth 
about religion, but that in order for civil society to exist at all there had to be an absolute 
separation between church and state. In religion, Williams was saying, every man had the right to 
his individual conscience, guided by the inner light of his faith. In secular matters, however, he 
must submit to the will of the majority, determined through institutions shorn of any religious 
41<br><br>
content. So to the Massachusetts elders Williams was not merely an antinomian, he was a 
secularist, almost an atheist, since he wanted to banish God from government. When Williams 
began to expose these views in his sermons, the authorities grew alarmed. In October 1635 they 
decided to arrest him and deport him to England. <br><br>
Winthrop was out of office at the time, or he might perhaps have taken a similar view. But, 
nursing his own wrongs, he concluded that the treatment of Williams was unjust and ungodly. In 
tiny England, there was no alternative but to suppress him. In vast America, he should be given 
the choice of planting himself elsewhere. So Winthrop, who knew what had been decided in 
council, secretly warned Williams of the plan to send him back to England and advised him to 
slip off from Salem, where Williams was established, into the Narrangansett Wilderness. As 
Williams himself related it: ‘[Winthrop] privately wrote to me to steer my course to 
Narrangansett Bay and the Indians, for many high and heavenly and public ends, encouraging 
me, from the freeness of the place from any English claims and patents.’ So Williams fled, with 
his wife Ann, their children, and their household servants. It was the beginning of the harsh New 
England winter, and Williams and his family had to spend it traveling through the forest, in 
makeshift shelters, until in the spring of 1636 he reached an Indian village at the head of 
Narrangansett Bay. To his dying day—and he lived to be eighty—Williams believed that his 
family’s survival was entirely due to divine providence, a fact which confirmed him in the 
rightness of his views. And he retained correspondingly bitter memories of his ‘persecutors.’ He 
negotiated a land purchase with two Indian tribes, and set up a new colony on a site he named 
Providence. He let it be known that his new settlement on Rhode Island welcomed dissidents of 
all kinds, fleeing from the religious tyranny of the Bay Colony. As he put it, `I desired it might 
be a shelter for persons distressed for conscience.’ By 1643, Portsmouth, Newport, and Warwick 
had been founded as further towns. <br><br>
Williams may have been an extremist. But he was also a man of business. He knew the law of 
England and the ways of government. He had no title to his colony and the Bay authorities would 
not give him one: they called Providence `the Sewer of New England.’ But he knew that 
parliament and the Puritans now ruled in London, so he went there. On March 24, 1644 
parliament, at his request, transformed the four towns into a lawful colony by charter, endorsing 
an Instrument of Government which Williams had drawn up. He took the opportunity, London 
being for the time being an ultra—libertarian city where the most extreme Protestant views could 
be circulated, to write and publish a defense of religious freedom, The Bloudy Tenet of 
Persecution for the Cause of Conscience discussed. And his new Instrument declared that `The 
form of government established in Providence Plantations is DEMOCRATICAL, that is to say, a 
government held by the free and voluntary consent of all, or the greater part, of the free 
inhabitants.’ Williams listed various laws and penalties for specific transgressions but added: 
`And otherwise than this, what is herein forbidden, all men may walk as their consciences 
persuade them, every one in the name of his God. And let the Saints of the Most High walk in 
this colony without molestation, in the name of Jehovah their God, for ever and ever.’<br><br> 
    Williams’ rugged angularity and unbiddable nature emerge strongly from his voluminous 
writings and correspondence. His new colony was by no means popular. Public opinion in 
Massachusetts was against it. It was believed to be a resort of rogues. Nor was it easy to get title 
to land there, as Williams insisted that any acquired from the Indians must be paid for at market 
rates. He opposed force, and was virtually a pacifist: `I must be humbly bold to say that it is 
impossible for any man or men to maintain their Christ by the sword, and to worship a true 
Christ."‘ The Rhode Island towns were stockaded and fortified. But Williams managed to avoid 
42<br><br>
any conflict at all with the Indians until the disaster of King Philip’s War in 1675—6. His Rhode 
Island colony thus got the reputation of being a place where the Indians were honored and 
protected. Then again, Williams was accused with some justice of being a man of wild and 
volatile opinions, an eccentric, an anti—establishment man. A few colonists liked that sort of 
thing. Most did not. Williams was actually governor of his colony only in the years 1654—7, but 
he was always the power behind the scenes. He set the tone. So he attracted the antinomians, but 
not much else. Even as late as 1700, the colony numbered only 7,000 inhabitants, 300 of them 
slaves. <br><br>
When Charles II was invited back to govern the British Isles in 1660, and the Puritan 
ascendancy ended, there was some doubt about the lawfulness of such colonies as Rhode Island. 
So Williams hastened to England and on July 18, 1663 he obtained from the King a charter 
confirming the privileges granted in 1644. This made the principle of religious freedom explicit 
and constitutes an important document in American history. `No person,’ it read, `within the said 
colony, at any time hereafter, shall be in any wise molested, punished, disquieted or called in 
question, for any difference in opinion in matters of religion, and who do not actually disturb the 
civil peace of our said colony; but that all ... may from time to time, and at all times hereafter, 
freely and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments and consciences in matters of 
religious concernments.’ Rhode Island was thus the first colony to make complete freedom of 
religion, as opposed to a mere degree of toleration, the principle of its existence, and to give this 
as a reason for separating church and state. Its existence of course opened the doors to the more 
angular sects, such as the Quakers and the Baptists, and indeed to missionaries from the 
Congregationalists of the Bay Colony and the Anglicans of Virginia. Williams himself was 
periodically enraged by what he saw as the doctrinal errors of the Quakers, and their stiff—
 necked obstinacy in refusing to acknowledge them. He was almost tempted to break all his own 
principles and have them expelled. But his sense of tolerance prevailed; the colony remained a 
refuge for all. The creation of Rhode Island was thus a critical turning point in the evolution of 
America. It not only introduced the principles of complete religious freedom and the separation 
of church and state, it also inaugurated the practice of religious competition. It thus accepted the 
challenge the great English poet John Milton had just laid down in his pamphlet Areopagitica 
appealing for liberty of speech and conscience: `Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose 
to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to 
misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood grapple: who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in 
a free and open encounter?’ Who indeed? Rhode Island was now in existence to provide a 
competitive field in which the religions—or at any rate the varieties of Christianity—could 
grapple at will, the first manifestation of that competitive spirit which was to blow mightily over 
every aspect of American existence. <br><br>
Yet it must be said that, in the 17th century at least, the way of the rebellious individual in 
New England was a hard one, especially if she was a woman. The case of Anne Hutchinson 
(1591—1643) is instructive. She was the first woman to achieve any importance in North 
America, the first to step forward from the almost anonymous ranks of neatly dressed, hard—
 working Puritan wives and mothers, and speak out with her own strong voice. Yet we know very 
little about her as a person. Whereas Winthrop and Williams left books and papers, often highly 
personal, which between them fill a dozen thick volumes, Mrs Hutchinson left behind not a 
single letter. She published no books or pamphlets—for a woman to do so was almost, if not 
quite, impossible in the first half of the 17th century. If she kept a journal, it has not survived. 
43<br><br>
The only real documentation concerning her is the record of the two trials to which she was 
subjected, which naturally leave a hostile impression." <br><br>
She came from Lincolnshire, one of thirteen children of a dissenting minister, Francis 
Marbury, who encouraged her early interest in theology and taught her everything he knew. She 
married a merchant, William Hutchinson, and had twelve children by him. But she kept up her 
religious enthusiasm and attended the charismatic sermons given by John Cotton at St Botolph’s 
in Lincoln. Under the `Godless tyranny’ of Archbishop Laud, Cotton lost his license to preach in 
1633, and promptly emigrated to the Bay Colony. Mrs Hutchinson, her husband, and children 
followed the next year, and she gave birth to another child shortly after they arrived in Boston. 
She was capable of delivering a child herself, and acted as a midwife on occasions. She also 
dispensed home—made cordials and `simples’ and gave medical advice to women. A natural 
leader, she made her house a resort for women in trouble. There is no need to read into her story 
the overtones of women’s rights with which feminist historians have recently embellished it." 
But it is clear she was formidable, and that she thought it proper and natural that women should 
participate in religious controversy. <br><br>
    It 
was Anne Hutchinson’s practice, along with her brother—in—law John Wheelwright, to 
hold post—sermon discussion groups at her house on Sunday afternoons and on an evening in 
midweek. There, the words of John Cotton and other preachers were analyzed minutely and at 
length, and everyone present—there were often as many as sixty, half of them women—joined in 
if they wished. Cotton himself, and Hutchinson and Wheelwright still more passionately, 
believed in a Covenant of Grace. Whereas most official preachers held that a moral life was 
sufficient grounds for salvation, Mrs Hutchinson argued that redemption was God’s gift to his 
elect and could not simply be earned by human effort—albeit the constant practice of good 
works was usually an external sign of inward election. The logic of this doctrine was subversive. 
The one power the clergy in New England still possessed was the right to determine who should 
be a full member of the church—and monitoring of his or her good works was the obvious way 
in which to do it. But the Hutchinson doctrine stripped the minister of this power by insisting that 
election, or indeed self—election, with which he had nothing to do, was the criterion of church 
membership. Such a system, moreover, by which divine grace worked its miracles in the 
individual without any need for clerical intermediary, abolished distinctions of gender. A woman 
might just as well receive the spirit, and utter God’s teachings, as an ordained pastor. Some 
people liked this idea. The majority found it alarming. <br><br>
    By 1636 the controversy was dividing the colony so sharply that the elders decided on extreme 
measures. Cotton was hauled before a synod of ministers and with some difficulty cleared 
himself of a charge of heresy. Then Winthrop was reelected governor in May 1637 and 
immediately set about dealing with Mrs Hutchinson, whom he regarded as the root of the 
problem. He put through an ordinance stipulating that anyone arriving in the colony could not 
stay more than three weeks without the approval of the magistrates. In November he had 
Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and their immediate followers up before the General Court, and 
banished. Some seventy—five of their adherents were disenfranchised and disarmed. He 
followed this up in March 1638 by having Hutchinson and Wheelwright charged with heresy 
before the church of Boston, and excommunicated. It is clear that Winthrop believed Anne 
Hutchinson was in some way being manipulated by the Devil—was a witch in fact. He 
discovered that she had had a miscarriage, which he interpreted as a sign of God’s wrath, and 
that her friend Mary Dyer had given birth to a stillborn, malformed infant—a monster. He even 
went so far as to have the pitiful body of the `monster’ dug up and examined. All this he 
44<br><br>
recorded in his diaries. He also communicated the results to England so `all our Godly friends 
might not be discouraged from coming to us.’ Mrs Hutchinson and her supporters, to save their 
lives, had no alternative but to leave the Bay Colony and seek refuge in Williams’ Rhode Island, 
where most of them settled and flourished. Her husband, a long—suffering man many might 
argue, died, and in due course the widow and his six youngest children moved further west, to 
Pelham Bay in what is now New York State. There, all but one daughter were killed by Indians 
in 1643. The violent death of Mrs Hutchinson and her brood was promptly interpreted as 
providential, and New England orthodoxy produced pious literature about the `American 
Jezebel,’ initiated by a violent pamphlet from the pen of Winthrop himself. Anne Hutchinson’s 
vindication, which has been voluminous and imaginative, had to wait for the women’s 
movement of the 1960s. <br><br>
The Hutchinson story showed that even the most radical dissent was possible, albeit 
dangerous. The practice in Massachusetts was to warn people identified as religious 
troublemakers to move on. If they insisted on staying, or came back, they were prosecuted. In 
July 1641, for instance, Dr John Clarke and Obediah Holmes, both from Rhode Island, were 
arrested in Lynn by the sheriff for holding an unauthorized religious meeting in a private house, 
at which the practice of infant baptism was condemned. Clarke was imprisoned; Holmes was 
whipped through the streets. Again, on October 27, 1659, three Quakers, William Robinson, 
Marmaduke Stevenson, and Mary Dyer, having been repeatedly expelled from the colony, the 
last time under penalty of death, were arrested again as `pestilential and disruptive’ and 
sentenced to be hanged on Boston Common. Sentence on the men was carried out. The woman, 
blindfolded and with the noose around her neck, was reprieved on the intervention of her son, 
who guaranteed she would leave the colony forthwith. She did in fact return, and was finally 
hanged on June 1, 1660. Other women were hanged for witchcraft—the first being Margaret 
Jones, sentenced at Plymouth on May 13, 1648 for `administering physics’ with the `malignant 
touch.’ Severe sentences were carried out on moral offenders of all kinds. Until 1632 adultery 
was punished by death. In 1639, again at Plymouth, an adulterous woman was whipped, then 
dragged through the streets wearing the letters AD pinned to her sleeve: she was told that if she 
removed the badge the letters would be branded on her face. Two years later, a man and a 
woman, convicted of adultery, were also whipped, this time `at the post,’ the letters AD `plainly 
to be sewn on their clothes.’ <br><br>
To buttress orthodoxy in Boston, a college for training ministers of religion was founded on 
the Charles River at Newtown in 1636, according to the will of the Rev. John Harvard. He came 
to the colonies in 1635 and left £780 and 400 books for this purpose. Three years later, the 
college was named after him and the place rechristened Cambridge, after the university where he 
was nurtured. The event was an index of the way in which the colony was achieving its primary 
objects. As one of the Harvard founders put it, `After God had carried us safe to New England, 
and wee had builded our houses, provided necessaries for our livlihood, rear’d convenient places 
for God’s worship and settled the Civill Government; One of the next things we longed for, and 
looked after was to advance Learning and Perpetuate it to Posterity."‘ But the college never had a 
monopoly of religious education, when dissenters could move off and found other establishments 
for teaching, without any need for a crown charter. In April 1638, for instance, the Rev. John 
Davenport led a congregation of pious Puritans from Boston, a town they claimed had become 
`corrupt,’ to settle in Quinnipiac, which they renamed New Haven. Davenport brought with him 
some successful merchants, including Theophilus Eaton and David Yale, the latter a learned 
gentleman whose descendant, Elihu Yale, was to found another historic college. Two months 
45<br><br>
later, on May 31, 1638, another dissenting minister, Thomas Hooker, arrived at Hartford on the 
Connecticut, with l00 followers, marking the occasion by preaching them a sermon stating that 
all authority, in state or religion, must rest in the people’s consent. Thus, within New England, 
there was a continuing diaspora, often motivated by religious dissent and the urgent desire for 
greater freedom of thought and action.<br><br> 
As far back as 1623, David Thompson had founded a settlement at Rye on the Piscataqua, the 
nucleus of what was to become New Hampshire. In 1639 Hooker’s Hartford joined with two 
other Puritan—dissenter townships, Windsor and Wethersfield, to form what they called the 
Fundamental Orders of Connecticut. Neither they nor Davenport’s New Haven had royal 
charters, but they constituted in effect a separate colony. From the 1620s there were further 
settlements up the coast in what was to become Maine, set up by dissenting fishermen. Annual 
new fleets from England reinforced all the areas of settlement. Between 1630 and 1660 about 
20,000 Puritans came out, with Massachusetts and Connecticut forming the core area of 
settlement. This was characterized by what have been called `Christian, utopian, closed and 
corporate communities.’ <br><br>
Some settlements were formal. New Haven had nine squares, the central square being a 
market—place, eventually occupied by the meetinghouse, court—house, schoolhouse, and jail. 
An early map survives of Wethersfield, one of the first of the Connecticut towns, showing 
houselots, adjacent field—lots, then outlying strips. Some of these early colony—towns were 
abandoned. But the vast majority survived with continuous occupation to this day. The fact is, 
the Puritans were successful settlers. They were homogeneous in belief, literate—they could read 
the many and often excellent printed pamphlets advising colonists—and skilled. Most of them 
were artisans or tradesmen, some were experienced farmers, and there was a definite sprinkling 
of merchants with capital. They came as families under leaders, often as entire congregations 
under their minister. Their unit—plantation was of several square miles, with an English—style 
village in the middle (in New England called a town), where all had houses, then lands outside it. 
There was, from the start, no egalitarianism. The free—enterprise investment system ensured 
that leaders and largest investors got bigger units. There was no symmetrical uniformity or 
pattern since the countryside was rugged and varied, and there was a universal pragmatism in 
adapting to the physical features of the place. When more space was needed, the congregation 
met and decreed a formal move to found a new township. This was the New England equivalent 
of an Old England village—but with no manor—house and tenant cottages. Virtually everyone 
came from England and Wales. The religious exclusivity of the original settlements rarely lasted 
more than a decade or so, with dissenters being expelled. Gradually, Anglicans, Baptists, and 
even Quakers were allowed to settle. Wealth—gaps widened in the second and third generation, 
rows and splits weakened church authority, the social atmosphere became more secular and 
mercantile, and the Puritan merged into the Yankee, `a race whose typical member is eternally 
torn between a passion for righteousness and a desire to get on in the world.’ 
Even Catholics were soon living in America in organized communities. This was the work of the 
Calvert family. George Calvert, born in 1597, was an energetic Yorkshireman who became 
James I’s Secretary of State and did some vigorous `planting’ in Ireland as well as investing 
largely in the East India Company and the Virginia Company. When he became a Catholic in 
1625 he retired into private life, but James made him a peer, Lord Baltimore, and encouraged 
him to found a colony for his fellow—papists. He looked at Newfoundland twice, but decided it 
was too cold. Then he visited Jamestown, but felt unable to sign the Protestant Oath of 
46<br><br>
Supremacy there. In the end Charles I gave him a charter to settle the northern Chesapeake area. 
It was left to his son Cecil, 2nd Baron Baltimore, to organize the actual settlement in 1633. He 
recruited seventeen younger sons of Catholic gentry to lead and finance the expedition, taking 
with them about 200 ordinary settlers, mostly Protestants, some of them married, a few farmers. 
They had two ships, the Ark, 350 tons, and the Dove, a mere pinnace, but both armed to the teeth. 
Various attempts were made by religious enemies to sabotage the venture and in the end 
Baltimore had to stay behind to protect its London end. Two Jesuits were taken aboard secretly 
at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Baltimore, who had studied Captain John Smith’s account of 
Virginia, gave handwritten instructions to his brother Leonard, who was to act as governor, and 
Jerome Halwey and Thomas Cornwallis, Catholic gentlemen, his co—commissioners. They were 
to get on good terms with the Virginians, using their Protestant passengers as intermediaries. 
They were not to disperse but to build a town and concentrate all their efforts on feeding 
themselves and becoming self—sufficient as quickly as possible. They were to train a militia and 
build a fort but to try and remain at peace with the Indians. The three leaders were to be `very 
careful to preserve unity and peace’ between the Protestants and the Roman Catholics: the 
Protestants were to receive `mildness and favour’, the Catholics to practice their faith as quietly 
as possible. <br><br>
One of the priests aboard, Father Andrew White, kept a record of the colony’s foundation, and 
found it full of splendid auguries for success. Of the Chesapeake he wrote: `This baye is the most 
delightful water I ever saw ... two sweet landes, firm and fertile: plenty of fish, woods of 
walnuts, oakes, and cedars.’ He noted `salad herbes and such like, strawberries, raspberries, 
fallen mulbery vines, rich soil, delicate springs of water, partridge, deer, turkeys, geese, ducks, 
and also squirrels, eagles and herons’—’the place abounds not only with profit but with 
pleasure.’ Maryland, he concluded, being halfway between the extremes of Virginia and New 
England, had `a middle temperature between the two, and enjoys the advantages, and escapes the 
evils, of each." <br><br>
The land was called Maryland after Charles I’s French wife, Henrietta Maria, and the 
township was St Mary’s. Father White had a cross set up and said a dedicatory mass on the 
shore, `to take solemn possession of the country.’ They traded axes, hoes, hatchets, and cloth for 
30 miles of land below the Wicomico River., Strictly speaking, Baltimore’s colony was, in 
English law, a feudal fiefdom, with palatine powers like those of the Bishop of Durham. He was 
answerable only to the King, owned all the territory granted, received rents, taxes, and fees, 
appointed all officials, exercised judicial and political authority, could build forts and wage 
defensive war, confer honors and titles, incorporate boroughs and towns, license trade, was head 
of the church, could erect and consecrate chapels and churches, and these his `ample rights, 
liberties, immunities and temporal franchises’ were to be enjoyed by him and his heirs for ever. 
But this was theory, English lawyers’ big talk. In practice none of these grandiose baronies based 
on feudal models worked as they were intended, quickly losing their gilding under the erosion of 
America’s democratic rock. To begin with, Baltimore did not have perfect title to his land. A 
Kentish man called William Claiborne, who had been in Virginia since 1621 and had erected a 
fur—trading stockade on Kent Island, disputed it. In law he was in the right, for Baltimore’s title 
excluded land already settled. Claiborne threatened to cause trouble, and did, once King Charles’ 
power collapsed in the 1640s. The American coast was already dotted with difficult loners like 
Claiborne, ferociously opposed to authority of any kind, litigious, well armed, and ready to fight 
if necessary. Then again, Baltimore’s charter specifically stated that the colonists were to enjoy 
`the full rights of Englishmen.’ That proviso was incompatible with the feudal trappings and was 
47<br><br>
far more likely to be turned into a reality. The first assembly of the colony met in January 1635, 
consisting of all freemen, that is males not bound in service. Within two years, and after some 
acrimonious arguments paralleling the debates in Westminster, it had won the legislative 
initiative. Thereafter there was no chance of Baltimore exacting his feudal privileges in full—
 quite apart from the fact that, from 1640, the Long Parliament in England systematically 
demolished what was left of the feudal system. <br><br>
The principal investors in the colony, called `Adventurers,’ who had to provide their own 
transport out plus five `able men’ between twenty and fifty, got 2,000 acres each. Anyone 
bringing less than five men got roc, acres, plus a further 100 for each man beside himself. 
Married settlers got 200 acres plus 100 for each `servant.’ Each child under sixteen got 50. 
Widows with children got the same grants as the men, and unmarried women with servants got 
50 acres for each. The land was freehold but owners had to pay Baltimore a ‘quitrent’—20 
shilling for a manor, 12 pence for a 50—acre tract, payable `in the commodity of the country’ 
and due annually for fifty years. If a man wanted to come and could not afford the voyage, he 
could travel free in return for a four— to five—year indenture of service. He made it with the 
captain, who sold it on landing to any bidder. The indenture bound the master to furnish 
transport, `meat, Drinke, Apparel and Lodging’ during the term and, on completion, to supply 
clothes, a year’s provision of corn, and 50 acres. Skilled men earned their freedom earlier.<br><br> 
    The actual apportioning of land proceeded swiftly—something Americans learned to do well 
very early in their history, and which was for 300 years one of their greatest strengths. A settler 
went to the secretary of the province, recorded his entitlement, and requested a grant of land. The 
secretary then presented a Warrant of Survey to the surveyor—general, who found and surveyed 
an appropriate tract. When he reported, the secretary issued a patent, which described the reasons 
for the grant, the boundaries and the conditions of tenure. The owner then occupied the land and 
began farming. Compared to the difficulties of acquiring land in England, even for ready money, 
it was amazingly simple. <br><br>
The farming went well from the start. The land produced a surplus the very first year and a 
load of grain was dispatched to Massachusetts for cash. But most farmers quickly went into 
tobacco, and stayed there. By the mid—1630s, tobacco prices, after a sellers’ market in the 
1620s, then a glut, had stabilized at about 4 to 6 shillings a pound. The Maryland settlers planted 
on creeks and rivers on the western shore, with wharves to receive annual tobacco—export ships. 
They killed trees by ‘girdling’—cutting a ring round the base—then planted. By 1639 the 
Maryland planters were producing 100,000 pounds of the ‘sotte weed.’ Tobacco planting was 
never easy. It required `a great deal of trouble in the right management of it.’ It was expert, 
labor—intensive, and tricky at all times. A plant had to be `topped,’ using the thumbnail. You 
could always tell a 17th—century tobacco farmer by his hard, green—stained thumb. Everyone 
worked hard, at any rate in those early days. The laborers and indentured servants did a twelve— 
to fourteen—hour day, with Saturday afternoon free and Sunday. They could be transferred by 
sale and corporally punished, and if they ran away they were punished by longer terms of 
service. They could not marry until their contract expired. In any case, men outnumbered women 
by two or three to one. There were lots of bastards and heavily pregnant brides—twice as many 
as in England. <br><br>
Housing was poor: `The dwellings are so wretchedly constructed that even if you are close to 
the fire as almost to burn yourself, you cannot keep warm and the wind blows through them 
everywhere." That was in the winter. The problem in summer was malaria. The more settlers 
who arrived, the more the mosquitoes bred. Those who got it were peculiarly susceptible to 
48<br><br>
smallpox, diphtheria, and yellow fever. Amebic dysentery, known as Gripes of the Gutts, was 
endemic. Maryland was noticeably less healthy than New England, where a male who survived 
to twenty lived generally to around sixty—five. In Maryland it was more like forty—three. 
About 70 percent died before fifty; only 6 percent of fathers lived to see their offspring mature. 
And half the children died before twenty. Wives worked very hard, in the tobacco fields, as well 
as by milking the cow, making cheese and butter, raising chickens, tending to the vegetable 
garden—mainly peas, beans, squash, and pumpkins. The men butchered but the wives cured, 
usually pork, which was the commonest meat. Corn was ground with pestle and mortar until the 
family could afford a grist—mill. These vigorous women were more partners than inferiors to 
their husbands. They lived longer and inherited more property than was usual in England. <br><br>
Despite the hardship, there was a feeling of nature’s bounty, thanks to tobacco. It was 
everything to the Marylanders. It was, in practice, the local currency. One settler, who wrote an 
account of the place, the Rev. Hugh Jones, called it `our meat, drinke, cloathing and moneys.’ 
The highest—priced variety, which was sweet—scented, the `true Virginia,’ would flourish only 
in a few counties in Virginia itself. Maryland grew mainly Orinoco, from South America. By the 
end of the 1630s a Maryland planter could produce 1,000 pounds a season, which rose to 1,500 
or even 1,700 later in the century. It is true that the soil soon became exhausted, the yield 
dropped, and planters had to move on. But they did so—land was cheap and plentiful—and thus 
the colony scattered and spread. Only four of the original gentlemen—adventurers stuck it out. 
But they became major landowners, with manor—houses, which in the next generation were 
rebuilt in fine brick. One of them, Thomas Gerard, soon farmed 6,000 acres. Four—fifths of the 
land worked fell within such manors; only one in five freemen claimed land, preferring to work 
as tenants or wage—earning landowners. Thus society rapidly became far more stratified than in 
New England. <br><br>
Maryland had a difficult time during the English Civil War. It was invaded by a shipmaster—
 pirate and parliamentary fanatic called Richard Ungle who, in conjunction with the still—
 smouldering and discontented Claiborne, pillaged the settlement, claiming the authority of 
parliament to do so. At one point, Claiborne and a fellow—parliament man went to London, 
ingratiated themselves with the authorities, and were made governor and deputy governor. They 
came back and sought to wage an anti—papist war of terror. Not only did they ban Catholic 
worship but they passed an Act outlawing sin, vice, and the most minute infractions of the 
sabbath. Throughout the 1640s and 1650s, religion as well as the proprietorial form of 
government were the issues: more particularly, the degree of toleration to be allowed to different 
faiths, and which exactly were to be excluded from it. But by the late 1650s toleration had won 
the battle. Maryland’s Toleration Act, based upon an Act Concerning Religion first pushed 
through the Assembly in 1649, not only laid down the principle of the free practice of religion 
but made it an offence to use hostile language about the religion of others, `such as Heretick, 
Schismatic, Idolator, Puritan, Independent, Presbyterian, Popish Priest, Jesuite, Jesuited Papist, 
Roundhead, Separatist and the like.’ But you could also be penalized for denying Christ was the 
Savior, the doctrine of the Trinity, or the Existence of God. A free—thinking Jew, Dr Jacob 
Lumbrozo, was later bound over for saying that Christ’s miracles were ‘magicianship and 
body—snatching.’ Thus toleration did not extend to outspoken Jews and atheists. But, for its 
time, it was an astonishing measure. Henceforward, no Christian whatever could `bee any wais 
troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free 
exercise thereof. ‘ 
49<br><br>
The Toleration Act proved invaluable to the colony. The upheavals in England, followed by 
the reassertion of royal authority and the imposition of the so—called Clarendon Code against 
dissenters, brought a rush of refugees of all religious persuasions to America, and large numbers 
chose to go to Maryland, where they lived perfectly happily together. The population had risen 
slowly to pass the 2,500—mark about 1660, but in the next twenty years it increased by 20,000. 
Maryland even took in Quakers. During its brief period of Puritan rule they were fined, whipped, 
jailed, and banished: they claimed the Indians treated them better than `the mad, rash rulers of 
Mariland.’ But once the Puritans were pushed out and the Toleration Act came back into force, 
the Calverts got the Quakers back, arguing that they were good citizens and farmers. One leading 
Quaker preacher, Wenlocke Christison, who had been whipped in Massachusetts, called his 
Maryland land—patent `The Ending of Controversie.’ Another, Elizabeth Harris, fleeing Boston 
where the authorities had stripped her and other Quaker women to find marks of witchcraft, gave 
sermons throughout the province, and George Fox himself came out there in 1672. By the late 
1670s, Quakers held regular meetings in fifteen different places in Maryland.<br> <br>
The colony attracted Dutch and German dissenters too. One group, the Labadists, of Dutch 
origin, had a remarkable German polymath leader, who drew the first good map of Maryland, 
had himself naturalized, and built up by 1674 an estate of 20,000 acres, making him the largest 
private landowner in America. Within ten years l00 Labadists were settled on this beautiful 
domaine, farmed with fine German—Dutch neatness and efficiency, sloping down to the 
Bohemia River and Chesapeake Bay. They followed the communal teaching of a Jesuit—
 turned—Calvinist called Jean de Labardie, sleeping in single—sex dormitories, eschewing 
private property, observing silence at meals, and denying themselves fires in winter. It was too 
strict and eventually dispersed, but it set a pattern of individualist utopian colonies in America 
which persists to this day and, in its own way, is one of the glories of the New World. 
Studying the history of these early settlements one is astonished—and delighted—by the 
variety of it all, and by the way in which accidents, events, and the stubborn individuality of 
ordinary men and women take over from the deep—laid schemes of the founders. The Calverts 
of Maryland attempted to create a perfect baronial society in America, based on status rather than 
wealth. But such an idea, it was already clear, simply did not work in America. The basic 
economic fact about the New World was that land was plentiful: it was labor and skills that were 
in short supply. To get immigrants you had to offer them land, and once they arrived they were 
determined to become individual entrepreneurs, subject to no one but the law. So the manorial 
courts rapidly gave place to elective local government. St Mary’s, like Jamestown, remained no 
more than a village. People just spread out into the interior, out of control of everything except 
the law, which they respected and generally observed. But they had to make the law themselves. 
It is important to remember that the area of settlement of North America covered thousands of 
miles of coastline and islands, from Providence Island off the coast of Central America, settled 
by Puritans in 1629, right up to Newfoundland, first exploited by two groups of fishermen, one 
Anglican, one Irish Catholic, who lived in separate areas there. Various towns claim to have `the 
oldest street in North America.’ The best claimants are Water Street, St John’s, Newfoundland, 
and Front Street in Hamilton, Bermuda—neither of them in what is now the United States. In the 
17th century there were in fact many scores of colonies, only a few of which would acquire full 
historical status. And not all of them were English. Leaving aside the French to the north, in 
Canada, and the Spanish to the south, there were the Dutch on the Hudson. As early as 1614 they 
settled upriver at Fort Nassau, opposite modern Albany. New York, or New Amsterdam as they 
50<br><br>
called it, was founded by them on May 4, 1626. During the Anglo—Dutch war of King Charles 
II’s day, it was conquered by Colonel Richard Nicolls on September 7, 1664, on behalf of 
Charles’ brother James, Duke of York, who got a charter to found a proprietary colony there. 
Despite a brief Dutch reoccupation in 1673—4, the English were able to consolidate their power 
in the Hudson Valley. One reason was that they left the Dutch settlers alone, with their lands and 
privileges, or rather encouraged them to enter their system of local government. In North 
America, the settlement and actual ownership of land came first. What flag you lived under was 
secondary—it was successful farming and ownership of land which brought you personal 
independence, the only kind which really mattered. Again, on the Delaware River, there was a 
mixed Swedish—Dutch—Finnish settlement at Fort Christian, dating from 1638. It called itself 
New Sweden, and when the English finally got control in 1674 it was the sixth change of flag 
over the colony in half a century. The settlers, overwhelmingly farmers—and good ones—did 
not mind so long as they were left in peace. <br><br>
The English, French, and Dutch, as well as the Spanish, scattered all over the Caribbean and 
the islands of Central America. Some islands changed hands again and again. The English put in 
the biggest effort, both of men and money. In the years 1612—46 alone, 40,000 English Puritans 
emigrated to various West Indian island—colonies. The most important by far was Barbados, not 
least because it became a springboard for colonization in the Carolinas on the American 
mainland. Barbados, unlike most of the other islands, was not a volcanic mountain sticking out 
of the sea but a limestone block with terraced slopes. It was uninhabited when the English 
arrived in 1627. First they tried planting tobacco, then cotton, both unsuccessfully. Then, during 
the English Civil War, there was an influx of royalist refugees, bringing capital and grand ideas, 
and Dutch expelled by the Portuguese from northeast Brazil. The latter knew about sugar—
 planting, and with the help of English capital they set up a sugar industry. From the start it was a 
huge commercial success, the first plantation boom—economy in English—speaking America. 
By the middle years of Charles II’s reign, there were 400 households in the capital, Bridgetown, 
175 big planters, 190 middling, and 1,000 small ones, 1,300 additional freemen, 2,300 
indentured servants, and 40,000 slaves. It was easily the richest colony in North America—its 
sugar exports were more valuable than those of all the other English colonies combined."‘ But 
with over 55,000 people on 166 square miles it was also the most congested. <br><br>
    A solution was found in 1663 when Charles II gave the Carolinas, unsuccessfully settled under 
his father in 1629, to a group of eight proprietors, who invited experienced colonizers, from the 
islands as well as from Virginia and New England, to take up land on easy terms. The 
Barbadians responded with enthusiasm. A first group came in 1664 to Cape Fear, but had to 
abandon it three years later. In 1670 a much larger group tried again, laying out Charlestown. 
This time it worked. Of course there was the usual nonsense from the proprietors of 12,000 acre 
`baronies’ and private courts—feudal ideas died hard among the more romantic gentlemen—
 adventurers. The actual Barbadian planters simply ignored the propaganda and went for the most 
likely sugarbearing lands on inlets and creeks. They ignored proprietorial guidance in other 
ways. The proprietors wanted religious toleration, in order to attract the maximum numbers of 
settlers. The planters were Anglicans, insofar as they were anything: they agreed with Charles II 
that it was `the only religion for gentlemen.’ So they made it their business to enforce second—
 class status on people from other faiths. The proprietors opposed slavery. The planters needed 
slaves, and got them. In one sense the wishes of the proprietors were carried out—the Carolinas 
got a stratified society, with three classes: a small ruling class of plantation owners or gentry, a 
large class of laborers, and an enormous number of slaves. 
51<br><br>
The settlement of Carolina was by no means exclusively Barbadian. There were also Scotch 
Presbyterians at Port Royal, Huguenots on the Santee, English dissenters west of the Edisto. And 
there were new waves of settlers from Ireland and France, as well as England. Nor did sugar do 
particularly well in Carolina. It can be argued that Carolina was saved by rice just as Virginia 
was saved by tobacco. The lands backing onto Charleston and the other river systems made 
perfect ricefields: it was easy to set up a water—control system, and rice—fields, unlike tobacco 
plantations, did not have to be moved every few years. But the essence of Carolina was a 
Barbadian slave—owning colony transported to the American mainland. This gave the place a 
distinctive social, political, and cultural character quite unlike the rest of the emerging colonies, 
even Virginia. Indeed, as we shall see, without this Barbadian implant, which became in due 
course the aggressively slave—owning state of South Carolina, the emotional leader of the 
South, it is quite possible that the American Civil War would not have taken place. <br><br>
Indeed, it is fascinating for the historian to observe how quickly different regions of the North 
American coast developed distinctive and deep—rooted characteristics. In Europe, where 
national forms go back to the pre—scriptive Dark Ages and beyond, these differences remain 
mysterious. In America there is no real mystery. The books are open from the start. The earliest 
origins of each colony are well documented. We know who, and why, and when, and how many. 
We can see foreshadowed the historical shape of things to come. With remarkable speed, in the 
first few decades, the fundamental dichotomy of America began to take shape, epitomized in 
these two key colonies—Massachusetts and Carolina. Here, already, is a North—South divide. 
The New England North has an all—class, mobile, and fluctuating society, with an irresistible 
upward movement pushed by an ethic of hard work. It is religious, idealistic, and frugal to the 
core. In the South there is, by contrast, a gentry—leisure class, with hereditary longings, sitting 
on the backs of indentured white laborers and a multitude of black slaves, with religion as a 
function of gentility and class, rather than an overpowering inward compulsion to live the godly 
life. <br><br>
Not that the emerging America of colonial times should be seen as a simple structure of two 
parts. It was, on the contrary, a complex structure of many parts, changing and growing more 
complex all the time. It was overwhelmingly English, as yet. But it was also already 
indestructibly multiethnic, preparing the melting—pot to come. It was also, compared with 
limited England, which was obliged to think small in many ways, already a place which saw 
huge visions and thought in big numbers. Bigness was the characteristic of Pennsylvania from 
the start. In 1682 William Penn (1644—1718) arrived at New Castle, Delaware bearing a 
massive proprietary grant from Charles II. He was the son of a rich and politically influential 
admiral, to whom Charles II was much indebted, both financially and otherwise. Penn had 
already dabbled in colonizing in the Jersey region, but his new charter, in full and final 
settlement of a £16,000 debt to his father, was on a princely scale and actually termed 
`Pennsylvania’ as a proprietary colony. Penn had become a Quaker in 1666, and suffered 
imprisonment for his beliefs, and he was determined to create a `tolerance settlement’ for 
Quakers and other persecuted sects from all over Europe. He called it his `Holy Experiment.’ 
There were Europeans in the area already—Swedes from 1643 at Tinicum Island, 9 miles south 
of modern Philadelphia, Dutch and English too. But they were few: Penn brought the many. His 
first fleet was of twenty—three ships, many of them large ones; and plenty more soon followed. 
Everything in Pennsylvania was big from the start. In Philadelphia, his city of brotherly love 
and capital, he had plans for what was later called a `Garden City,’ which he termed a ‘Greene 
Country Town,’ spread out on an enormous scale so that every houseowner would have `room 
52<br><br>
enough for House, Garden and small Orchard.’ In fact this did not happen: Philadelphia grew up 
tightly on the Delaware waterfront, and was manifestly from the start a city built for high—class 
commerce. But it was quite unlike Boston, whose narrow, winding streets recalled medieval 
London. Philadelphia was a proud and self—conscious example of contemporary town—
 planning, made of brick and stone from the start, and much influenced by the new baroque 
London of squares and straight streets. It was laid out on a large scale to fill, eventually, its entire 
neck of the river, with twenty—five straight streets bisected by eight. All these streets had proper 
paving and curbing, sidewalks and spaced—out trees. <br><br>
    Into this colony radiating from Philadelphia, Penn poured multitudes of Quakers, from Bristol 
and London, many of considerable property, who bought the best lots in the city, but also from 
Barbados, Jamaica, New York, and New Jersey, from Wales—forming a separate, Welsh—
 speaking area which kept its culture for generations—and from the Rhineland, founding a city 
they called Germanopolis. Penn wanted the settlement dense for cultural as well as economic 
reasons: `I had in my view Society, Assistance, Busy Commerce, Instruction of Youth, 
Government of Peoples’ Manners, Conveniency of Religious Assembling, Encouragement of 
Mechanics, distinct and beaten roads.’ He wrote home: `We do settle in the way of townships or 
villages, each of which contains 5,000 acres or at least ten families ... Our townships lie square; 
generally the village in the Center, for near—neighbourhood. But it rarely proved possible to 
carry out these schemes. In practice, land was simply sold off in lots of a hundred acres or more. 
Again and again in early America, planning—good, bad, or indifferent—was defeated by 
obstinate individualism. The European notion of the docile, contented peasant, living in 
agricultural villages under a squire, was an anachronism, or becoming one. A new pattern of 
owner—occupiers, producing food for the market, was already to be found in England, where 
they were known as yeomen. America was a natural paradise for such a class, where they were 
called simply farmers. And Pennsylvania, with its rich soil, was particularly well adapted to 
promote their numbers and interests. These farmers pushed inland from the river valleys into the 
low hills of piedmont of the interior, and then across the first range or corrugation of the 
Appalachian mountains in what was known as the Great Valley. Here was `the best poor man’s 
country,’ the ideal agricultural setting for a farmer with little capital to carve out not only a 
subsistence for his family but, through hard and skillful work, a marketable surplus for cash. So 
Pennsylvania soon became known as the `Bread Colony,’ exporting a big surplus not only of 
grain but of livestock and fruit. Huge numbers of immigrants arrived and most did well, the 
Quakers setting the pattern. They were well dressed, they ate magnificently, and they had money 
jingling in their pockets.  <br><br>
Amid this prosperous rural setting, it was natural for Philadelphia to become, in a very short 
time, the cultural capital of America. It can be argued, indeed, that Quaker Pennsylvania was the 
key state in American history. It was the last great flowering of Puritan political innovation, 
around its great city of brotherly love. With its harbor at Philadelphia leading up the Delaware to 
Pittsburgh and so to the gateway of the Ohio Valley and the west, and astride the valleys into the 
southern back country, it was the national crossroads. It became in time many things, which 
coexisted in harmony: the world centre of Quaker influence but a Presbyterian stronghold too, 
the national headquarters of American Baptists but a place where Catholics also felt at home and 
flourished, a center of Anglicanism but also a key location both for German Lutherans and for 
the German Reformed Church, plus many other German groups, such as Moravians and 
Mennonites. In due course indeed it also housed the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the 
first independent black denomination. With all this, it was not surprising that Philadelphia was an 
53<br><br>
early home of the printing press, adumbrating its role as the seat of the American Philosophical 
Society and birthplace of the American Declaration of Independence. 
But much, indeed most, of this was for the future. The question has to be asked: was early 
America a hard—working but essentially a prosaic, uncultured place? Were the attitudes of early 
Americans, when they were not narrowly religious, equally narrowly mercantile? It is a curious 
fact that, whereas in England the 17th century was an age of great literature—and the actual 
language used by those New Englanders, such as Winthrop and Roger Williams, who did set 
down their thoughts on paper, was often expressive and powerful—the New World was 
strikingly slow to develop its own literature. There is more than one argument here, however. 
Cultural Bostonian historians of the late 19th century were inclined to dismiss their forebears as 
horribly uncivilized. Charles Francis Adams wrote: `As a period it was singularly barren and 
almost inconceivably somber.’’ On the contrary, argued the great Samuel Eliot Morison: the 
Puritan clergy and many leading layfolk were notable in their anxiety to educate and 
distinguished by their interest in science. They did everything possible to promote intellectual 
activity by founding schools and colleges. It is true they disliked individualism, a necessary 
ingredient in cultural creativity. Perry Miller, the historian of the Puritan mind, argued that they 
were communalists, who believed that government should interfere and direct and lead as much 
as it could, in all aspects of life. And when necessary it should discipline and coerce too. Puritans 
saw the individualist as a dangerous loner, meat for the Devil to feed on. As one of them, John 
Cotton, put it, `Society in all sorts of humane affairs is better than solitariness. The Puritans 
believed they had the right to impose their will on this communally organized society. <br><br>
John Davenport of Connecticut summed up the entire Puritan theory of government thus: 
`Power of Civil rule, by men orderly chosen, is God’s ordinance. It is from the Light and Law of 
Nature, because the Law of Nature is God’s Law.’ They did not accept that an individual had the 
right to assert himself, in religious or indeed in any matters. When in 1681 a congregation of 
Anabaptists published an attack on the government of Massachusetts Bay and appealed to what 
they called the `tolerant spirit’ of the first settlers there, Samuel Willard, minister to the Third 
Church in Boston, wrote a pamphlet in reply, with a preface by Increase Mather, saying: `I 
perceive they are mistaken in the design of our first Planters, whose business was not toleration 
but were professed enemies of it, and could leave the world professing they died no Libertines. 
Their business was to settle and (as much as in them lay) to secure Religion to Posterity, 
according to that way which they believed was of God. <br><br>
In this kind of would—be theocracy, it was difficult for cultural individualism to flourish. But 
the elites proposed—and the people disposed themselves otherwise. Sermons, tracts, and laws 
say one thing; town and church records often show that quite different things actually happened. 
The New England rank and file contained many individualists who would not be curbed by 
Puritan leaders. If there were enough of them, there followed a heated town—meeting, an 
unbridgeable difference, a split—and a move by one faction. A study shows that this is exactly 
what happened in Sudbury, Massachusetts, in the 1650s, leading to the founding of Marlboro, 
Massachusetts. The head of the conservative faction, Edmund Goodnow, put his case thus: `Be it 
right or wrong, we will have [our way] ... If we can have it no other way we will have it by club 
law.’ To which the leader of the younger generation, John How, replied: ‘If you oppress the 
poor, they will cry out. And if you persecute us in one city, wee must fly to another.’ And so they 
did."‘ The early Americans were lucky people—they had the space for it. <br><br>
Individualism did assert itself, therefore, even in Puritan New England. Indeed in a sense it 
had to, for America was a do—it—yourself society. Potential settlers were warned they would 
54<br><br>
have to depend on their own skills. A London broadsheet of 1622 has survived entitled `The 
Inconvenients that have happened to Some Persons which Have transported Themselves from 
England to Virginia, without Provisions Necessary to Sustain Themselves.’ It advised that 
settlers should take arms, household implements, and a list of eighteen tools, recommended to be 
carried in duplicate, from axes to saws and shovels, not excluding a grindstone. Early settlers 
erected their own huts, and made their own furniture when necessary. <br><br>
But it was not always necessary, even in the earliest decades. It is a notable fact that America, 
from the start, had a powerful attraction for skilled men. The reason was clear. One of the 
original Mayflower backers, Robert Cushman, wrote that England was a poor place for an honest 
man to raise a family. The towns, he said, `abound with young tradesmen and the hospitals are 
full of the ancient. The country is replenished with new farmes, and the alehouses are filled with 
old labourers. Many are those who get their living with leaving burdens; but more are fain to 
burden the land with their whole bodies. Multitudes get their means of living by prating and so 
do numbers more by begging.’ He complained that `even the most wise, sober and discrete men 
go often to the wall, when they have done their best.’ He and others pointed out that a skilled 
young man in England had a poor economic future, and no status at all, since status was entirely 
dependent on land, which he had virtually no hope of acquiring. In America, he could get higher 
wages, and his raw materials were cheap. And there was a strong likelihood he could get land 
too. <br><br>
    So there was no shortage of craftsmen in the colonies. Carpenters and joiners were particularly 
fortunate. Not only was wood plentiful and in great variety: it was also cheap in sawn lengths. 
One of America’s earliest innovations was the rapid spread of water—driven sawmills. England 
had no real tradition of mechanical sawing. America by contrast had masses of timber located 
near fast—flowing streams. So mills were built everywhere but particularly in New England. 
They saved labor—the biggest item in furniture—making. One small waterpowered mill could 
produce seven times the output of two skilled sawyers. There was waste of material—so what? 
Timber was plentiful; it was human labor which was scarce. Settlers were moving from an 
economy of scarcity to an economy of plenty, where men were valuable to a degree unknown in 
Europe. It was this fact which shaped the early culture. <br><br>
Excellent furniture was made in 17th—century America, and a surprising amount of it has 
survived. There were skilled glassmakers from the start, for glass was difficult to transport with 
safety and had if possible to be manufactured on the spot. We know there were professional 
glassmakers on the first Virginia voyage of 1608. They flourished because raw materials, 
particularly wood, were cheap and easily available. The shortage of skilled labor attracted 
foreigners as well as Englishmen: the first glass—factories in America, both in Jamestown, were 
run by Venetians and Poles. The same principle applied to pottery. Suppliers were unwilling to 
ship pots across the Atlantic, saying there was no money in it. So potters went instead. The 
skilled English ceramicist Philip Drinker was in Charlestown, Massachusetts, by 1635 working 
away. The Dutch ‘pottmaker’ Dirck Clausen was turning out ware on Manhattan Island by 1655. 
Redware was the quintessential American pioneer ceramic, dictated by the clays available 
(porcelain was not successfully manufactured in America until the 19th century). It came with 
simple abstract geometric patterns, rather like protoclassical Greek pottery of the 8th century BC, 
then with written mottoes: `Mary’s Dish,’ `Clams and Oysters,’ and `Pony Up the Cash.’ But 
very little survives from the 17th century. <br><br>
Records exist of dozens of other categories of craftsmen at work in America by the mid—17th 
century. Thus, by the 1630s, two expert shoemakers, Henry Elwell and Philip Kirkland, were 
55<br><br>
already settled in Lynn, Massachusetts, later to become a major shoe—manufacturing center. 
They specialized in women’s shoes. Church silver was in demand from early on—even the 
Puritans liked it. In fact by the end of the 17th century superb silver, almost on a par with the 
European best, was being made in Boston. One of the interesting points about New England 
craftsmen is that they came from all ranks—something impossible in 17th—century England. 
The best Boston silversmith—goldsmith was Jeremiah Dummer, born in 1645, the son of a 
leading landowner. He was a member of the Boston elite and invested in shipping, but he was 
not above slaving at his bench making candlesticks for prominent families and Boston churches. 
That was the kind of social mobility which augered well for America’s future. <br><br>
It is, however, a futile quest to look for much in the way of fine art produced in 17th—century 
America. Only about thirty paintings have survived from this period, all of them amateurish. We 
know the names of men described as painters but it is impossible to match them convincingly to 
the surviving paintings. Any who practiced as painters did so intermittently, it seems.  One or 
two Dutchmen in New York Gerrit Duyckinck (1660—1712) for instance—combined portrait 
painting with other crafts, such as glazing. There were virtually no architects in the first decades. 
Men, even men with many acres, designed their own houses: the tradition of the rich amateur 
architect began early in America. Thus there is Adam Thoroughgood’s house in Norfolk, 
Virginia, 1636—40, of brick, in a mixture of Elizabethan and Jacobean styles, with a huge, 
medieval—type chimney. Another early Virginia house, built by Arthur Allen and known as 
Bacon’s Castle, had towers, front and rear, massive chimney—stacks, and Flemish gables. All 
the writers were amateurs too, be they authors of works of travel, like John Smith or William 
Bradford, or Puritan poets like the metaphysician Edward Taylor of Westfield, Massachusetts 
(c.1644—1729) or Michael Wigglesworth, whose theological poem, Day of Doom, published in 
Cambridge in 1662, popularized Puritan dogma in ballad meter. <br><br>
Yet there was one sense in which early America was abreast of the European world, even 
ahead of it. It had a deep—rooted, and increasingly experimental, political culture. Here the 
English tradition was of incomparable value. It was rich and very ancient. By comparison, the 
French and Spanish settlers knew little of the art of politics. Both France and Spain, as 
geographical entities with national institutions, were still recent developments in the 17th 
century, and neither had much experience of representative government, or even at that date of 
unified legal systems. By contrast, England had been a national unity since the 9th century, with 
forms of representation going back to that date and even beyond. Its common law began to 
mature as early as the 12th century; its first statute of the realm, Magna Carta, was enrolled as 
early as 1215; its parliaments, with their knights of the shire and their burgesses of the towns, 
had had a continuous history since the 14th century, as an institution which passed laws for all 
the people and raised revenues from all of them too. Behind the Englishmen who came to settle 
in Virginia and Massachusetts, in Carolina and Maryland and Pennsylvania, were 1,000 years of 
political history. <br><br>
    Moreover, it must be said that the period at which this tradition was implanted in America was 
also of great significance. English America `took off’ as a viable social and economic entity in 
the three decades 1630—60. That was when its population reached a critical mass large enough 
to produce self—sustaining growth. And it was during these three decades that there took place 
in England a veritable explosion of political argument and experiment, in which, perhaps for the 
first time in history, the fundamentals of participatory and democratic politics were discussed. It 
could be said, indeed, that modern politics was invented in the England of the 1640s, and the 
English settlers in America were, in a sense, participants in this process—the coming and going 
56<br><br>
between England and America during this decade was of great political significance. If the 
English had first settled America in the first half of the 16th century, during the Tudor autocracy, 
or in the first half of the 18th century, during the long calm of the Whig supremacy, it might 
have been a very different story. But they settled it during the first half of the 17th century, when 
the smoldering dispute between king and parliament reached its climax, burst into flames, and 
was resolved by a parliamentary victory, albeit a qualified one. The English settling in America 
brought with them this political tradition, just when it was at its most active and fruitful. 
The early settlers, then, came from an intensely religious and political background, and most 
of them were independent—minded, with ingrained habits of thinking things out for themselves. 
And it was the earliest settlers who counted most. It is almost a law of colonization that the first 
group, however small, to set up an effective settlement has more effect on the political and social 
character of the colony than later arrivals, however numerous. Until Charles II’s reign, indeed 
until the 1680s, by which time the English had effectively wrested maritime control of the North 
Atlantic from the Dutch, the English crown made little attempt to supervise closely what went on 
across the Atlantic. It awarded charters, then let the colonists get on with it. This was an old 
tradition in England, applying particularly to local government through justices of the peace 
(magistrates), sometimes referred to as `Self—government by the King’s Command.’ So 
governors, however appointed or elected, operated independently of England. And every colony, 
almost from its inception, and in most cases within a year of its foundation, had some kind of 
representative assembly. Electing people was one of the first things a settler in America learned 
to do. Moreover, many offices in America which, in England, would have been filled by 
appointment, by lords lieutenant or even by the crown—key offices in the administration and 
enforcement of the law—became elective from the start. <br><br>
The American tradition of electing large numbers of public officers directly took deep root 
quickly. Those men so chosen might be very humble people. Forty years after the foundation of 
Maryland, governors were complaining that many men chosen as justices or sheriffs could not 
even sign their names. Virtually everyone voted for somebody or other. In orthodox Calvinist 
New England, voting rights, to begin with at least, were confined to church members. Elsewhere 
all freemen had them, as a rule. In Maryland, for instance, at least from the 1650s, all freemen 
voted for four delegates per county to serve in the Lower House. It was linked to service in the 
militia, compulsory for every male over sixteen: if you fought for the colony, you voted in it. In 
Carolina, you voted automatically if you took up a 50—acre plot, though to be a delegate you 
were supposed to have 500 acres. These 50—acre men were lowly folk who would never have 
been allowed to take part in politics in Europe: Thomas New, who came out in 1682, described 
them as `tradesmen, poor and wholly ignorant of husbandry ... their whole business was to clear 
a little ground to get bread for their families. But they voted all the same. Some of the Carolina 
elite, who originally tried to call themselves ‘landgraves’ and ‘cassiques,’ grumbled at this. As 
one of them put it, `It is as bad as a state of Warre for men who are in want to have the making of 
Laws over Men that have Estates. But it was a fact of colonial life, even in Carolina, explained 
partly by the proprietors themselves being mostly absentee landlords. As an independent—
 minded Caroliner wrote in the 1670s: ‘By our frame [of government], noe bodys power, noe not 
of any of the Proprietors themselves were they there, is soe great as toe be able to hurt the 
meanest man in the Country.’ <br><br>
You may ask: how did the early settlers reconcile their acceptance that even the meanest had 
rights—including rights to vote—with the institution of slavery? The point was to be made with 
great force by Dr Samuel Johnson at the time of the American Revolution, and it echoes through 
57<br><br>
American history: `How is it that the loudest YELPS for LIBERTY come from the drivers of 
Negroes?’ The answer is that America was only gradually corrupted into the acceptance of 
large—scale slavery. The corruption entered through Carolina, whence it came from Barbados. 
In the West Indian islands, those occupied by the Spanish, Portuguese, and French under 
Catholic teaching, slaves were treated as actual or potential Christians, with souls and rights—
 not just property. In the islands occupied by the English and Dutch Protestants, who got their 
doctrine about slavery from the Old Testament, slaves were seen as legal chattels, with no more 
rights than cows or sheep. The Barbadian planters in Carolina, who set the tone, never troubled 
themselves to Christianize their slaves and even prevented others from doing so. In any case, it 
made no difference. Early laws laid down that baptism did not change a person’s free or unfree 
status. Such laws spread north. Thus in 1692 a Maryland statute insisted that baptism did nothing 
to change a black’s servile status. <br><br>
Carolina was the first slave state, properly speaking. From the start it imported black slaves, 
even before it acquired rice as an agricultural staple. A Carolina promotion pamphlet of 1682 
stated flatly: `without [negro slaves] a planter can never do any great matter.’ The same year, a 
settler told a friend: `Negroes are more desirable than white servants. This was because a white 
indentured servant cost £2—£4 a year in capital investment. A slave cost £18—£30 outright, plus 
the likelihood of breeding. Young, healthy female slaves were particularly valuable for this 
reason. In Maryland, slavery grew only slowly. Until the late 1680s, an estate was more likely to 
be run by indentured labor. Early probates from the years 1658—70 show that only 15 out of 150 
estates had slaves. But the treatment and legal status of slaves, especially black ones, declined as 
the 17th century wore on. A statute of 1663 recognized black service as perpetual, writing of 
`Negroes and other Slaves who are incapable of making Satisfaction by Addition of Tyme.’ A 
black had to prove he was under limited contract by producing documents, otherwise the law 
assumed he (and his children) was a chattel slave. <br><br>
    Much legislation of these years strengthened the hands of the planters against slaves. In 
Carolina, slavery was an early source of corruption in politics. Slavers were heard to boast that 
they could `with a bowl of punch get who they would Chosen of the parliament and afterwards 
who they would Chosen of the Grand Council. The Barbadians in Carolina also enslaved 
numbers of Indians. This was strictly against the law. The policy of Charles II’s government was 
`to get and continue the friendship and assistance of the Indians and make them useful without 
force or injury.’ It laid down (1672) that enslavement of Indians was forbidden `upon any 
occasion or pretence whatsoever. But the Barbadian planters induced Indian tribes—who did not 
need much persuasion—to make war on others to produce Indian slaves. An early anti—slaver in 
Charleston, John Stewart, wrote angry letters home to England, protesting about the behavior of 
the Barbadians, or `Goose Creek Men’ as he called them (this was their densest area of 
settlement). He said that one of their leaders, Maurice Matthews, an important man because he 
was the official surveyor as well as a planter and slaver, was `Hell itself for Malice, a Jesuit for 
Design politick.’ Stewart eventually got Matthews sacked for slaving. His predecessor, Florence 
O’sullivan, was as bad: `a very siddencious, troublesome Man, an ill—natured buggerer of 
children,’ as other settlers complained.<br> <br>
All the same American slavery was on a small scale, Carolina being the only exception. 
Large—scale slavery was an 18th—century phenomenon. Even by 1714 there were fewer than 
60,000 slaves in the whole of the English colonies on mainland America. Thereafter the numbers 
grew steadily—78,000 by 1727, 263,000 by 1754, and 697,000 at the first census in 1790. So in 
Dr Johnson’s day the existence of huge, black, servile multitudes in America was a recent 
58<br><br>
development, growing daily—one reason he was so outraged by it. In early settler times, by 
contrast, over most of the colonies, slavery was very marginal, blacks were almost invisible, and 
servile work was seen in terms of indentured whites, who served their terms, became freemen 
and soon owned land and exercised their votes. So the leading settlers, creating their assemblies, 
were not struck by the paradox of free whites and blacks who had no rights at all. That came 
later—when it was too late and slavery was deeply entrenched. <br><br>
The early lack of interest by the English government in the American mainland colonies led, 
therefore, both to a rapid growth of legislative assemblies, with wide franchises and, rather later, 
to an unregulated growth of slavery. When the home country first began to take a closer interest, 
during Charles II’s reign, its main concern was with regulated trade. By an Act of 1660, 
`enumerated’ commodities from the English mainland colonies in America had to be sent direct 
to England. These included tobacco, cotton, wool, indigo, to which were later added tar, pitch, 
turpentine, hemp, masts, yards, rice, copper, iron, timber, furs, and pearls. These included all the 
staples of the South, chiefly tobacco, rice, and indigo. But, further north, leading exports like 
fish—for a long time the chief staple of New England—grain, and other foods were kept out of 
England by high tariffs. So the North, especially New England, sent to the West Indies and 
southern Europe dried fish, pickles and pickled beef and pork, horses and livestock, plus building 
materials. New York and Philadelphia sent flour and wheat. As, by the closing decades of the 
17th century, the West Indies was concentrating largely on sugar and tobacco, it imported food 
and wood cheaply from the mainland colonies. In return, they got molasses, to turn into rum for 
the fishing fleet and to buy slaves. If they were lucky, they got gold and silver too. 
The cash was welcome, because under this mercantalist system the balance of trade was in 
England’s favor and there was a chronic shortage of coin in America. Any specie they got from 
the West Indies ‘seldom continues six months in the province before it is remitted to Europe.’ 
Business was accounted in pounds, shillings, and pence, but English coin was seldom seen. 
Large—scale internal trade was done in drafts and bills of exchange, local trade in barter. Termly 
bills of students at Harvard College were for decades met by produce, livestock, and pickled 
meat. In 1649 one student is recorded as settling his bill with `an old cow.’ The accounts for the 
college’s first building includes one item: `Received a goat 30S plantation of Watertown rate, 
which died.’ All kinds of dodgy procedures were used to get round the shortage of specie. Thus 
in Virginia and Maryland, receipts for tobacco deposited in warehouses circulated as cash. Then 
colonial governments began to create paper credit—a slippery slope. In 1690 Massachusetts 
created bills of credit for payment to militia soldiers. This example was eagerly followed, and 
such paper money acceptable, at a discount, for silver and marked with a date of payment soon 
spread. But this was followed by larger, weaker issues, which discredited it. So American paper 
money tended to be rotten from the start, and distrust of it—followed by distrust of the banks 
which circulated it—became deep—rooted in Americans from an early date, and was to have 
very long—term consequences. Primitive `loan banks,’ issuing credit on the security of real 
estate, made the financial system even more suspect. Parliament in England, instead of solving 
the problem by ensuring that America got enough coin, stamped on the consequences of the 
shortage as an abuse. In 1751 it forbade issue of further bills of credit as legal tender in New 
England, and in 1764 it extended the ban to all the colonies. This both infuriated the Americans 
and proved ineffective, since by then an estimated $22 million of unlawful paper was already in 
circulation. It was an early example of the way in which government from both sides of the 
Atlantic would not work.

Irritation with England, whenever the home government exercised any authority at all, was an 
early American characteristic. It is a curious fact that the first printed work ever published in 
America, put out by Stephen Daye in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in January 1639 (he had come 
out only the year before) was a broadside, The Oath of a Free—Man, attacking the oath of 
allegiance all settlers had to swear to the English crown. Taxes in goods were exacted on settlers, 
without much success to be sure, and some of this got back to the English crown. But in return it 
was hard for the colonies to see what they got, other than notional protection. The home 
government certainly did nothing to defend outlying farms or plantations from occasional Indian 
raids—for that, the settlers were left entirely to their own devices. On the whole, relations 
between English settlers and Indians were good and there was surprisingly little conflict. When it 
occurred, the settlers were usually to blame. But not always. The Indians were capable of 
unpredictable changes of mood, and downright bellicosity under a certain type of leader. 
Settler—Indian relations were complicated by disputes among Indian tribes, which were often in 
a state of perpetual warfare with each other. <br><br>
This was the origin of the Pequot War in the 1630s. It began with a dispute between the 
Pequots and the Mohicans in the Connecticut River area, over the valuable shoreline, whose 
shells and beads were collected for wampum, the Indian form of exchange. Neither the English 
nor the nearby Dutch would come to the aid of the Mohicans and they were beaten. The Pequots, 
`grown arrogant,’ attacked an English sea—captain, John Stone, and his seven companions, who 
were trading upriver. They were murdered. Two years later, there was another murder, on Block 
Island, of a New England trader, John Oldham. In response, the Massachusetts governor, John 
Endecott, sent three armed vessels, which destroyed the two Indian villages believed to have 
been guilty of these crimes. In May 1637, the Pequots retaliated by attacking Wethersfield, 
Connecticut, killing nine people and abducting two. This in turn provoked a combined operation 
by all the militia forces of Massachusetts and Connecticut, accompanied by several hundred 
Narragansett and Niantic Indians, who together surrounded the main Pequot fort on June 5, 1637, 
and slaughtered 500 Indians, men, women, and children, within it. The village was set on fire 
and most of those who tried to escape were shot or clubbed to death.  This bloody war against the 
Pequots, which seems to have ended Indian raiding in New England for a generation, was 
conducted without any assistance from England.<br> <br>
    Further south, in the Hudson Valley and Virginia, wars among the Indians, and with settlers 
over fur and trading, continued sporadically. In June 1644 as many as 350 settlers south of the 
James River were massacred by the warriors of a chieftain called Opechancanought. This led to 
large—scale counterattacks by the governor of Virginia, William Berkeley, and the acting 
governor Richard Kemp. Again, only the local militia was employed. There was a major flare—
 up in Dutch territory near the Hudson the same year. Near New Amsterdam, 120 Algonquins, 
fleeing from their Mohawk enemies, were massacred by the Dutch in retaliation for early 
murders. Various Algonquin tribes then united for a vengeful raid against Dutch settlements, but 
were defeated when 150 heavily armed Dutch killed 700 Indian warriors near Stamford, 
Connecticut, in February 1644. <br><br>
In Virginia it was a constant complaint among settlers pushing into the interior that the 
authorities never provided them with any protection from hostile Indians. The trouble with 
Virginia, as indeed with other colonies, is that although its latitude, that is its extent along the 
coast, was fairly accurately determined by original charters, its extension inland was indefinite. 
There was an early conflict of interest between the large plantation—owners of the Tidewater, 
who dominated the assembly and ran the government, and the smaller farmers who penetrated
